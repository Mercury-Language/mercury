# RESERVED_MACRO_NAMES
#
# This file lists the macro names, other than the ones starting with a
# certain set of allowed prefixes that are defined by the Mercury header files.
# The Mmakefile target `check_headers' automatically checks that no other
# macro names are defined. This is done to keep our headers namespace-clean,
# i.e. ensure that we don't invade the user's namespace.
#
# This file is used as the argument to `fgrep -f'.
# Lines starting with `#' will not match anything in the input,
# and can thus be used as comments.
# Other lines are treated as strings to match against.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# This is documented in the Mercury language reference manual
# and defined by mercury_types.h.

# pid_t is only defined in mercury_conf.h if it is not present
# in the system headers. I don't think there is a nice way to
# prefix this without requiring a later version of autoconf (e.g. 2.52).

# This is defined by mps_gc/code/mercury_mps.h,
# which uses this macro for its header guard.
# Normally it would be better to use uppercase for header guard macro names,
# but that would be inconsistent with the coding style used in mps_gc/code.
mercury_mps_h
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# This is defined by mercury_getopt.h
# That header file is NOT #included by any of the other
# headers, so this doesn't cause any name space polution.

# These are defined by mercury_signal.h. The first is defined only temporarily,
# and the second eliminates gratuitous differences between Linux versions.
# Neither really pollutes the namespace.

sigcontext_struct

# These are defined automatically by GCC -- gcc optionally passes
# them on the command line when calling cc1, depending on the
# exact options which gcc was invoked with.  These are not
# namespace polution, since they are in the _[A-Z]* namespace
# which is reserved for the C implementation, and they are being
# defined by the C implementation.

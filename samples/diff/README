The Mercury modules in this directory have been derived from the
'diff' sample distributed with Mercury 0.6.  That sample carries the
following copyright information, description and to-do list (in
diff.m):

% File: diff.m
% Main author: bromage

% Something very similar to the standard diff utility.  Sort of.  :-)

% On the still-to-do list:
%	- Add command-line options.  Probably:
%		--ignore-all-space
%		--ignore-blank-lines
%		--ignore-case
%		--rcs
%	  What others are easy and don't break up the code?


The major changes I made were

* Moved code for manipulating and displaying diffs to a separate
  module called diffs.m (and changed their calls in diff.m).  The type
  'lcss,' needed both by the rest of lcss.m and by diffs.m, was moved
  to a new module lcsstype.m.

* Made lcss.m independent of files, and allowed it to process any kind
  of list by adding polymorphism.  (The file processing calls have
  been moved to diff.m.)

* Added type synonyms 'pos' and 'segment' in diffs.m to clarify the
  types.  Renamed 'single_diff' to 'edit'.

* Added end-of-file match to the generated lcss, thereby allowing the
  to_diff predicate to be simplified considerably.

* Numbered lists from 0 internally in the lcss-algorithm.  This made
  to_diff simpler still, but also forced changes in the diff-printing
  part.

* Removed the swapping in find_lcss, because it doesn't seem to help.

* The array(string) representing a file in file.m was also renumbered
  to begin with 0.

* Added and corrected comments.

Have fun,

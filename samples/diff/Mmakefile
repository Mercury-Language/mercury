# An example of a *short* Mmake file
# In fact you don't really need any Mmake file at all,
# just `mmake diff.depend; mmake diff' is enough.
# But `mmake depend; mmake' is standard, so we will
# define a target `depend' and a default target `all'
# to make that work.

# This source file is hereby placed in the public domain.  -fjh (the author).

MAIN_TARGET=all
depend: diff.depend
all: diff

# Unfortunately, diff does not work quite properly when compiled with gcc
# 2.7.2 under Digital Unix 3.2 due to a bug in gcc.  The bug was fixed
# in 2.7.2.1, so feel free to comment out this line if you're using
# an unbuggy compiler.
#
# BTW, the predicate which isn't compiled correctly is diff_out__show_file_2
# in diff_out.m.

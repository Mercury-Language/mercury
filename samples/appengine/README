This is a very simple demo of how to deploy Mercury code to Google App Engine
using the Java backend.

The code should also work with any other servlet container.

The file servlet.m contains a simple request handler written in Mercury.  It
also contains some Java foreign code that defines a subclass of
javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.

To run this sample, first download the Google App Engine SDK from
http://code.google.com/appengine/.

After unzipping the SDK, add the file lib/shared/servlet-api.jar to your
CLASSPATH.  Also add the SDK's bin directory to your PATH.

Make sure you have a recent Mercury compiler with the java grade installed and
that mmc is in your PATH.

To build the servlet do:
    
    make

To run the servlet locally do:

    make run

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/.

To deploy the servlet to Google App Engine, first edit the file
war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml and change the application id one you've created.
You can create a new application at https://appengine.google.com/.  Then do:

    make deploy

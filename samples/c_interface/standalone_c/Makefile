# This directory contains an example of how to create and use a stand-alone
# interface.  Stand-alone interfaces allow exported Mercury procedures to be
# called from "foreign" applications, that is applications whose entry point
# is something other than a Mercury main/2 predicate.  (By "exported" Mercury
# procedure we mean one that is the subject of a pragma foreign_export
# declaration.)
#
# A stand-alone interface consists of an object / header file pair.  These
# define a pair of functions whose respective tasks are to initialise and
# shutdown the Mercury runtime plus a given set of Mercury libraries that the
# foreign application may wish to use.  It is important to initialise the
# Mercury runtime before calling any Mercury procedures.  The header file
# created as part of the stand-alone interface is compatible with either C or
# C++.
#
# Stand-alone interfaces are created by invoking the compiler with the
# `--generate-standalone-interface' option.  The Mercury libraries that the
# foreign application may wish to use are specified via the usual mechanisms,
# e.g. the `--ml' and `--mld' options.  The Mercury standard library is always
# included amongst the set of libraries.
#
# In this example there is a small foreign application written in C contained
# in the file c_main.c.  This application calls some Mercury procedures
# defined in the Mercury library `mercury_lib' (which is contained in the file
# mercury_lib.m).  The program also manipulates the value of a mutable defined
# in this library.
#
# To build the application we first compile `mercury_lib'.  For this example
# we don't bother installing it since that would just lead to the command
# lines being unwieldy.  We then build the stand-alone interface, which in
# this example is called mercury_lib_int.  Finally, we compile c_main.c and
# link them all together.  Specific details concerning each step in the build
# process are discussed below.  See c_main.c for details of how to invoke the
# stand-alone interface from C or C++ code.

# This variable holds the options required to set the grade.

# By default, we link our application statically against the Mercury libraries.
# If you wish to use the shared versions of the Mercury libraries, comment
# out the next two lines and uncomment the two following them.

# Note that we specify the example mercury_lib library to the linker separately

CC = $(shell $(MMC) --output-cc)

# We need to tell the C compiler to define the macros used to specify the
# compilation grade in which any Mercury libraries we are using were compiled.
# We also need to tell the C compiler where to find the C header files
# associated with those libraries.  The simplest way to find out both of these
# is to ask the Mercury compiler what flags it passes to the C compiler.
# This can be done as follows:
#
# CFLAGS = $(shell $(MMC) $(GRADEOPT) --output-cflags)
#
# Note that the output of the `--output-cflags' option also includes any other
# flags that the Mercury compiler passes to the C compiler, for example options
# that control optimisation settings.
#
# We use a finer grained approach here that only queries the Mercury compiler
# about which macros to define for the current grade and what directories to
# search for header files in.  This finer grained approach is useful if a
# foreign application is written in, for example, C++ instead of C.  In that
# case not all of the flags output by --output-cflags may be valid for the
# C++ compiler.

# Ask the Mercury compiler what flags to pass to the C compiler in order to
# define the macros used to specify the compilation grade we are using.

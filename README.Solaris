Mercury 0.13 may not work on Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) due to incompatibilities
with the version of Boehm GC shipped with that version of Mercury.

(The above problem has been fixed in post-0.13 versions of Mercury.)

Also, note that `--linkage static' is not supported on Solaris.  Executables
produced using this option will cause a segmentation fault.

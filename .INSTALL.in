# INSTALL - installation instructions and installation script.
#
# You need GNU C (version 2.7.2 or later, we recommend version 2.95.x,
# version 3.0 will not work) and GNU Make (3.69 or later).  Make sure
# that they are somewhere in your PATH.  It's also helpful if you have
# GNU Readline installed in one of the standard locations (normally
# /usr/local or /usr), but this is not essential.
#
# The source distributions for GNU C, GNU Make, and GNU Readline are
# available from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/>.  Binaries for these are
# included in almost all Linux distributions and also in the Cygwin
# distribution for Windows (see README.MS-Windows).
#
# Step 0.  Extract the files from the gzipped tar archive.
#
# Step 1.  Run `configure'.  (Just type `sh configure'.)
#
#	   By default, the files will be installed in the directory
#	   /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@.
#	   If you want the files to be installed someplace else,
#	   use the `--prefix <directory>' option to `configure'.
#	   The directory name specified with the `--prefix' option
#	   must not contain spaces.
#
#      NOTE: If you use the `--prefix' option to configure,
#      be aware that `mercury' is not automatically
#      appended.  That is, `--prefix=/usr/local' will put
#      files in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib et cetera,
#      *not* /usr/local/mercury/bin, /usr/local/mercury/lib.
#
#	   By default, the installation process will install the Mercury
#	   standard library in a comprehensive set of grades, with each grade
#	   supporting a given set of capabilities (debugging, profiling etc).
#	   If you want to install a different set of grades, read the
#	   "Finetuning" section below.
#
#	   The output from running configure will be automatically saved
#	   in the file `configure.log'.  Some debugging output is also
#	   saved to the file `config.log'.
#
# Step 2.  Run `make'.
#	   This step will take a long time.
#
#	   The output from this stage will be automatically saved in the
#	   file `make.log'.
#
#      NOTE: If you have problems installing a new version
#      of the compiler, you may find it helpful to either
#      completely remove any existing versions of the
#      compiler reachable on your PATH or, less drastically,
#      alter your PATH variable so that any existing version
#      of the mercury compiler is not accessible for the
#      purposes of installing the new version.
#
# Step 3.  Run `make install'.
#	   This step will also take a long time.
#
#	   The output from this stage will be automatically saved in the
#	   file `make_install.log'.
#
#	   BEWARE: if something goes wrong in this step, e.g. running
#	   out of disk space, and the installation has already gotten
#	   past installing the documentation, and started installing
#	   the different grades of the libraries (in particular if
#	   `grep install_text make_install.log' prints out something
#	   like `# install_text install_ps') then in general it is NOT
#	   sufficient to simply rerun `make install'.  Instead you
#	   may need to start from scratch again.
#
# Step 4.  Check the permissions on the installed files.
#	   Add /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/bin to your PATH, and
#	   add /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/man to your MANPATH.
#	   add /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/info to your INFOPATH.
#	   You can also add a WWW link to the Mercury documentation in
#	   /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/html to your WWW home page,
#	   and you may want to print out a hard-copy of the documentation
#	   from the DVI files in /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/doc.
#
#	   If step #1 enabled deep profiling, then check whether "make install"
#	   was able to copy scripts/mdprof to your web server's CGI directory
#	   (usually /usr/lib/cgi-bin). This directory is often writeable only
#	   by root or by the web server administrator, so you may need more
#	   than your usual set of privileges to do the copy (i.e. you may
#	   need to "su" to the appropriate user).
#
#	   To use the emacs debugger interface ("M-x mdb"), you also need to
#	   add the following lines to the `.emacs' file in your home directory:
#
#	   	(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name
#		  "/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/elisp") load-path))
#		(autoload 'mdb "gud" "Invoke the Mercury debugger" t)
#
# Step 5.  Run `make clean'.
#
# As a short-cut, steps 1-3 are listed below, so they can be replaced
# by just executing this file.  I suggest you run it in the background,
# and read the Mercury documentation in the `doc' directory while you are
# waiting.

sh configure &&
make &&
make install

# Fine-tuning:
# ------------
#
#	   If your system has multiple CPUs and lots of RAM,
#	   you can uncomment the definition of PARALLEL in the Makefile
#	   to perform a parallel make.
#
#	   By default the `make install' step will install a reasonable
#	   set of library grades which should be appropriate for most uses.
#
#	   The option --enable-libgrades=<gradelist> allows you to specify
#	   precisely the list of library grades to be installed. The argument
#	   of this option should be a comma-separated list of grades.
#	   An empty list of grades will cause the library to be installed
#	   only in the default grade.
#
#	   The option --disable-most-grades reduces the set of installed grades
#	   to a "minimum" level for developers (just the default grade and the
#	   grades corresponding to the `--debug' and `--high-level-code'
#	   options).
#
#	   The option --disable-nogc-grades prevents the installation
#	   of grades without garbage collection.
#
#	   The option --disable-prof-grades prevents the installation
#	   of grades that support profiling.
#
#	   The option --disable-trail-grades prevents the installation
#	   of grades that support trailing.
#
#	   The option --disable-par-grades prevents the installation
#	   of thread-safe grades.
#
#	   The option --enable-inefficient-grades causes the installation
#	   of grades that do not exploit gcc extensions even when they are
#	   available.
#
#	   The option --enable-hlc-prof-grades causes the installation
#	   of profiling versions of the high level code grades.
#
#	   The option --disable-dotnet-grades prevents the installation
#	   of the .NET grades (see README.DotNet) even if the Microsoft
#	   .NET SDK is installed. These grades are never installed if
#	   the .NET SDK is not found.
#
#	   The option --enable-deep-profiler=/some/dir/name enables the deep
#	   profiler, and specifies the directory in which to install the
#	   deep profiler's CGI script. The option --disable-deep-profiler
#	   causes the deep profiler not to be installed, even if the underlying
#	   system would be able to support it. The default is to enable the
#	   deep profiler and to install its CGI script in /usr/lib/cgi-bin
#	   if that directory exists and if the system has the required
#	   features.
#
#	   If you are short on RAM, you can add -DSMALL_CONFIG to the CFLAGS
#          line in the file boehm_gc/Makefile.  (This tells the garbage
#	   collector to tune itself for small physical memory.)
#
#	   If your system supports shared libraries, but `configure' says
#	   Mercury does not support shared libraries on this system,
#	   contact us and we'll see if we can add support for shared libraries
#	   on that system.
#
#	   If Mercury does not support shared libraries on your system,
#	   you may want to use the command `mmake install_split_library' to
#	   build and install a version of the Mercury libraries using the
#	   `--split-c-files' option to avoid linking in unused procedures.
#	   This can reduce the size of a hello world executable from ~400k
#	   to ~120k.  (The only reason this is not the default is that
#	   installing the split libraries takes quite a long time.  As a
#	   compromise, the command `mmake install_split_library LIBGRADES='
#	   will install a split version of the library just for the
#	   default grade.)
#
#	   Efficiency will be much improved if Mercury can use gcc global
#	   register variables.  Currently these are supported for
#	   mips, hppa, sparc, alpha, rs6000, and i386 architectures
#	   (see runtime/regs.h and runtime/machdeps/*).
#	   If you want to use Mercury on some other CPU, contact us and
#	   we'll add support for gcc global registers for that CPU.
#
# De-installation:
# ----------------
#
# You may eventually want to uninstall this version of Mercury
# (to free up disk space so you can install the next version ;-).
# If you installed in the default location, you can simply
# use `rm -rf /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@' to uninstall.
# If you installed in a location such as `/usr/local' that also
# contains other files which you do not want removed, then
# run the command `make uninstall' in this directory.

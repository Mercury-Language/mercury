The Mercury implementation is free software.
It is Copyright (C) 1993-2012 The University of Melbourne and
Copyright (C) 2013-2019 The Mercury team.

The compiler and tools are distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.  See the file COPYING for copying permission.

The Mercury core libraries (the files in the browser, java/runtime,
library, mdbcomp, runtime, ssdb and trace subdirectories) are
distributed under the terms specified in the file COPYING.LIB.

If those licensing arrangements are not satisfactory, please
contact us.  We are willing to offer alternative arrangements,
if the need should arise.

--------

The subdirectory `boehm_gc' contains a slightly modified copy of the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector. See boehm_gc/README.md for
copyright information.

The atomic_ops library (libatomic_ops) contains some code that
is covered by the GNU General Public License, but is not needed by, nor
linked into the collector library or Mercury. It is included here only
because it is simpler to include the libatomic_ops distribution in its
entirety.

--------

The files in the `getopt' directory, as well as runtime/mercury_getopt.c,
runtime/mercury_getopt_long.c and runtime/mercury_getopt.h, are derived
from the musl library. See the files for copyright information.

--------

A few files (config.guess, config.sub) are derived from code that is
copyright by the Free Software Foundation, Inc, and are distributed
under the GNU General Public License version 2.

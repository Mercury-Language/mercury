%
% This module adds implicit quantifications of some variables just inside
% trace goal scopes in order to avoid a minor but annoying problem, which can
% also be confusing for people who come across it the first time.
%
% Consider the following code:
%
%       :- pred p(int::in, int::in, int::out) is det.
%    
%       p(A, B, X) :-
%           trace [io(!IO)] (
%               ToPrint = A,
%               io.format("A = %d\n", [i(ToPrint)], !IO)
%           ),
%           trace [io(!IO)] (
%               ToPrint = B,
%               io.format("B = %d\n", [i(ToPrint)], !IO)
%           ),
%           X = A + B,
%           trace [io(!IO)] (
%               ToPrint = X,
%               io.format("X = %d\n", [i(ToPrint)], !IO)
%           ).
%
% Since the variable ToPrint is used inside more than one trace goal,
% the compiler's usual scope rules consider it to be a nonlocal variable
% in each trace goal. This is a problem, because the compiler does not allow
% trace goals to bind variables that are not local to the trace goal.
% It does this to preserve the ability of the program to work whether or not
% the trace goal is there, since it can be deleted if either its compile_time
% or run_time condition turns out to be false.
%
% However, in cases like this, where the nonlocal variable occurs *only*
% inside trace goals, leaving ToPrint unbound if a trace goal is deleted
% will not affect the execution of the program. Having it bound more than once
% if the trace goals *aren't* deleted would be a problem, but this is easily
% fixed by making ToPrint existentially quantified inside each trace goal;
% that way, each trace goal will bind and use its own copy of ToPrint.
%
% The job of this module is to find out which variables in a clause body
% are used only inside trace goals, and to insert the quantifications
% into trace goals as necessary to ensure that all such variables
% will end up being local to each trace goal scope. The part of the compiler
% that ensures this is the quantification pass, which is invoked on the
% goal we generate pretty much immediately after we return it.
%
% The overall effect of putting this pass before the quantification pass
% is a minor tweak of the usual rules of quantification, a tweak that
% makes the rules enforced by the compiler resemble the rules expected
% by programmers more closely, helping the compiler approach closer to the
% principle of least astonishment.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%
% The pre-quantification algorithm is based on dividing the clause body
% into one or more zones, each identified by a non-negative integer.
% The zones are based on viewing the clause body as a tree:
%
% - with each goal being a node,
% - atomic goals being leaf nodes, and
% - each compound goal having a subtree for each subgoal.
%
% If lambda goals didn't exist, each zone would be identified by its top node.
%
% The top node of zone 0 is the root of the tree, while the top node of
% every other zone is a trace goal, i.e. a scope goal whose scope_reason
% is trace_goal. Every trace goal is the top node of a zone, with the
% exception of trace goals that are contained inside other trace goals.
% (We have no rule against nesting trace goals, though they don't make
% much sense, and I (zs) have never seen such nesting.)
%
% The zone that each node belongs to is the zone whose top node you first find
% when you traverse the tree upwards from the node. In other words, each zone
% claims the nodes beneath it, except the ones that are claimed by another
% zone whose top node is lower down.
%
% Since lambda goals do exist, we have to handle them. We do so by considering
% the lambda goal to be effectively a separate predicate body inside this
% clause (since the compiler will eventually turn it into that). So the
% top level of a rhs_lambda_goal is also considered to be in zone 0.

:- type zone == uint.

:- func top_zone = zone.
:- pragma inline(func(top_zone/0)).

top_zone = 0u.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%
% The pre-quantification algorithm has three main steps.
%
% - The first step is to find out which variables are used in which zones.
%   This is done by build_vars_to_zones_in_*, which build the VarsToZones map.
%
% - The second step is finding out which variables occur only inside
%   trace goals, not outside them. These variables should be local to the
%   trace goals they appear in. If they occur in only one trace goal,
%   ordinary quantification will ensure this. We need to add explicit
%   existential quantifications for them only if they occur inside
%   more than one trace goal. In terms of zones, this means variables
%   that don't occur in zone 0 but do appear in more than one other zone.
%   (We call these variables the "duplicated" variables.) The job of
%   build_zones_to_dup_vars is to map each trace goal zone to the list
%   of variables that needs to have an existential quantifier added for it
%   in the scope of that trace goal, and to return that as ZonesToDupVars.
%
% - The third step is to go through the clause body and insert those
%   existential quantification scopes inside every trace goal scope
%   that contains one or more of these "duplicated" variables.
%

    % Our parent ensures that we don't get called on clauses that
    % don't contain any trace goals. Most clauses that have trace goals
    % will have only a few of them, so the sparse_bitset(zone) will
    % typically contain only a single node.

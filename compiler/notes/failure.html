<h1>Management of failure in the LLDS code generator</h1>

This document describes the arrangement
for handling failure in the LLDS code generator.
It builds upon allocation.html,
which describes the mechanism we use
to preserve the values of variables that may be needed on backtracking
and the mechanism we use to set up resumption points.

<p>

<h2>Runtime data structures</h2>

In the design of the nondet stack,
two registers point to nondet stack frames.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
The maxfr register always points to the topmost nondet stack frame.
<li>
While executing a model_non procedure,
the curfr register points to the ordinary nondet stack frame of that procedure.
While executing a model_det or model_semi procedure,
the curfr register points to the nondet stack frame
of the nearest model_non ancestor of that procedure.
(In the following, we will consider that any model_det or model_semi procedure
is effectively part of its nearest model_non caller.)
</ul>

<p>
Each ordinary nondet stack frame contains five fixed slots:
<p>

<ul>
<li>
prevfr, the address of the previous frame on the nondet stack
<li>
redoip, the label to go to when backtracking reaches this frame
<li>
redofr, the value to set curfr to when backtracking through redoip
<li>
succip, the label to go to on success
<li>
succfr, the value to reset curfr to on success (frame of our caller)
</ul>

<p>
Ordinary nondet stack frames may also contain the values of variables
and/or temporary values such as saved trail pointers.
<p>
All temporary nondet stack frames
contain the three fixed slots, prevfr, redoip and redofr.
Temporary frames created by model_det and model_semi procedures
also have a fourth fixed slot, detfr, which points to the stack frame
(on the det stack) of the procedure that created them.
Temporary nondet stack frames
never contain any slots except these fixed slots.
Therefore for any given nondet frame its size determines its type.
If this is three words,
it is a temporary frame created by a model_non procedure;
if this is four words,
it is a temporary frame created by a model_det or model_semi procedure;
if this is five words or more,
it is an ordinary frame.
<p>
The fixed slots prevfr, redoip and redofr
are present in all nondet stack frames, ordinary and temporary,
at the same offset and with the same semantics.
Therefore code that accesses only these fields of a nondet stack frame
does not need to find out what kind of frame it is.
<p>
The detfr slot is for the accurate garbage collector;
it is never used by the backtracking mechanism.
Therefore in the following we can and will treat all temporary frames the same.
<p>
In grades that support stack segments,
the runtime system puts a sentinel frame
at the bottom of every segment after the first.
The sentinel frame appears as an ordinary frame,
with all five of the usual fixed slots,
but the two fields that ordinarily contain the success continuation
are not used for that purpose,
since sentinel frames do not correspond to calls, and thus cannot return.
Instead, the succfr slot contains
the value of the curfr abstract machine register
at the time the sentinel frame was created,
and the succip slot contains the address of the notreached label.
The address of the memory zone structure
that contains the segment the sentinel is at the bottom of
is stored in the sentinel frame's one framevar.
Sentinel frames can be distinguished from other ordinary frames
by the fact that their redoip slot contains
the address of the label in the runtime
that pops the segment off the nondet stack.

<h2>Runtime actions</h2>

The redo() macro is implemented as
<p>

<pre>
curfr = redofr_slot(maxfr);
goto *redoip_slot(maxfr);
</pre>

<p>
while the fail() macro discards the top nondet stack frame
and then executes a redo().
<p>
It is an invariant that
curfr will always point to an ordinary nondet stack frame;
it will never point to a temporary frame.
<p>
It is an invariant that for any nondet stack frame whose address is frame_addr,
redofr_slot(frame_addr) == frame_addr whenever curfr == frame_addr. However,
it is possible that redofr_slot(frame_addr) != frame_addr at other times.
<p>
One implication of this possibility is that
at a point in the code where execution may resume after a redo(),
the code of a procedure can assume that curfr == maxfr at that point
only if it did not hijack any frames anywhere to the left of that point.

<h2>Code generator data structures</h2>

The proposed code generator uses two data structures for managing failure:
the resume point stack and the left context.
It also consults the option --allow-hijacks
that says whether hijacks (see below) of nondet stack frames are allowed.
Grades that call for accurate garbage collection imply --no-allow-hijacks.

<h3>The resume point stack</h3>

Several kinds of goals want to get control on failure.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Disjunctions want control
    <ul>
    <li>
    when a nonlast disjunct fails, and
    <li>
    when something executed to the right of the disjunction fails.
    </ul>
<li>
If-then-elses want control when the condition fails.
<li>
Negations are a special case of if-then-elses.
<li>
Commits want control when the committed goal fails.
</ul>

<p>
These kinds of goals can be nested inside each other.
<p>
Whenever we are about to generate code for a goal
after whose failure we want to get back control,
we push an entry onto the resume point stack.
This entry gives the arrangements for the resumption point;
the details of the arrangement are described
in the "Resumption points" section of allocation.html.
<p>
The depth of the resume point stack reflects the depth of nesting of
goals that want to get control on failure.
<p>
It is an invariant that the resume point stack is the same before and
after generating code for a goal.

<h3>The left context</h3>

When the code generator looks at a goal,
the left context field of code_info gives information about
what happened to the left of this goal
that may affect how we handle failures in this goal.
<p>
The left context has three subfields.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
The resume_point_known subfield can take on
one of the two values known and unknown,
saying whether the code generator knows what label to branch to on failure.
The answer is yes if there is no nondet code between
the establishment of the tightest enclosing resume point
and the start of the current goal.
<p>
If the resume point is known,
the compiler state also records whether
the redoip slot of the top nondet stack frame
is known to contain the address of this resume point.
XXX The rest of this document has not been updated
to reflect how we handle this extra component of the failure handling state.
<p>
<li>
The curfr_maxfr subfield can take on
one of the two values must_be_equal and may_be_different,
saying whether the code generator knows that
curfr is guaranteed to be equal to maxfr.
The answer is yes if all of the following conditions hold:
    <ul>
    <li>
    we are in a procedure that lives on the nondet stack
    (maxfr and curfr are both set to the address of the procedure's
    stack frame when it is created);
    <li>
    there are no calls to nondet procedures on the path between
    the start of the procedure and the start of the current goal; and
    <li>
    the code generator itself hasn't pushed any temporary nondet
    stack frames (see below).
    </ul>
    <p>
<li>
The condition_environment subfield can take on
one of the two values inside_non_condition and not_inside_non_condition,
saying whether we are inside a model_non goal
that is the condition of an if-then-else.
</ul>

<p>
The resume_point_known subfield is initialized to known in all procedures.
The curfr_maxfr subfield is initialized to
must_be_equal in model_non procedures,
and to may_be_different in other procedures.
The condition_environment subfield
is always initialized to not_inside_non_condition.
<p>
When the code generator processes any nondet goal,
it must set the resume_point_known subfield to unknown at the end of the goal.
<p>
When the code generator processes a model_non construct
that leaves this procedure (i.e. a call, higher order call or method call),
it must also set the curfr_maxfr subfield to may_be_different
at the end of the goal.
(Since a model_non procedure can remove its own stack frame
just before it succeeds for the last time,
we can't say that after a call to such a procedure
maxfr *will* be different from curfr.)
<p>
When the code generator processes branched structures (if-then-elses,
switches or disjunctions), if resume_point_known is unknown at the end of
any arm, it must be unknown after the branched structure, and if curfr_maxfr
is may_be_different at the end of any arm, it must also be may_be_different
after the branched structure.
<p>
When the code generator establishes a new resumption point,
it will set the resume_point_known subfield to known,
but it must not set the curfr_maxfr subfield to must_be_equal.
<p>
Note that in the absence of model_non code, the resume_point_known subfield
will always have the value known.

<h3>Generating failure</h3>

How we generate code for failure depends on the top entry on the resume
point stack and the left context.
<p>
If resume_point_known is no, the code we generate for failure is redo().
If resume_point_known is yes, the code we generate for failure is a branch
to one of the labels in the resumption point; which one depends on the
locations of the variables needed at the resumption point
(see allocation.html).
<p>
To prepare for backtracking to a resumption point that takes place via
a redo(), not via a direct branch, we must select one of the labels
as the one whose address will be put in the redoip slot via which backtracking
will take place. This label will be the stack label, the label whose
resume map maps all the resume variables to their stack slots.
<p>
We have to make sure that this choice is always valid.
We do this by enforcing three invariants:

<ul>
<li>
We never generate redo() for failure if resume_point_known is known,
and we always generate redo() for failure if resume_point_known is unknown.
<p>
<li>
At all points when resume_point_known goes from known to unknown,
we make sure that the resume variables are flushed to their stack slots.
<p>
<li>
If, while a resumption point is active,
control can reach a point where resume_point_known goes from known to unknown,
liveness.m ensures that the resumption point includes a stack label.
</ul>

<h3>Classifying left contexts</h3>

The code generator classifies left contexts
into those in which hijacking is allowed,
and those in which hijacking is not allowed.
Hijacking is allowed only if the --allow-hijacks option is set,
and the condition_environment subfield is not_inside_non_condition.
<p>
The code generator further classifies left contexts
in which hijacking is allowed into the following three categories:
<p>

<ul>
<li> best case:
resume_point_known is known and curfr_maxfr is must_be_equal
<li> middle case:
resume_point_known is unknown and curfr_maxfr is must_be_equal
<li> worst case:
curfr_maxfr is may_be_different
</ul>

<p>
The code generator can treat any situation as a no-hijack case,
it can treat best case as either middle case or worst case,
and it can treat middle case as worst case.
However, it should be able to generate better code
if it exploits the available information.
<p>

It may be that no-hijack case yields better code than worst case;
this should be investigated TODO.

<h2>Handling disjunctions</h2>

<h3>Handling nondet disjunctions</h3>

<ul>
<li> No-hijack case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before entering the disjunction, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        creates a temporary nondet stack frame.
        </ul>
    <li>
    When the code generator enters a nonlast disjunct,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point at the start of the next disjunct, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame (which is the temporary frame)
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    When the code generator enters the last disjunct,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it does not push any entry on the resume point stack, and
        <li>
        sets maxfr to the value in the prevfr slot of the top frame
        (which is the temporary frame),
        which pops the temporary frame off the stack.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
<li> Worst case.
    <ul>
    Before entering the disjunction, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        saves in two stack slots
        the contents of the redoip and redofr slots of the top frame,
        (which may be different from this frame), and
        <li>
        sets the redofr slot of the top frame from curfr,
        so that backtracking through the redoip slot of that frame
        will set curfr to point to this frame.
        </ul>
    <li>
    When the code generator enters a nonlast disjunct,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point at the start of the next disjunct, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    When the code generator enters the last disjunct,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it does not push any entry on the resume point stack, and
        <li>
        restores the redoip and redofr slots of the top frame
        (which may be different from this frame),
        to their old, saved values.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    In this case, the disjunction hijacks a frame that may not be its own.
    We call this a full hijack; it involves two saves and two restores.
<li> Middle case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before entering the disjunction, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        saves in a stack slot the contents of the redoip slot of the top frame
        (which is this frame, and whose redofr slot must point to this frame).
        </ul>
    <li>
    When the code generator enters a nonlast disjunct,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point at the start of the next disjunct, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame (which is this frame)
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    When the code generator enters the last disjunct,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it does not push any entry on the resume point stack, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame (which is this frame)
        to its old, saved value.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    In this case, the disjunction hijacks its own frame
    while having to save the value in the hijacked slot.
    We call this a half hijack,
    since it involves one save and one restore.
    <p>
<li> Best case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    When the code generator enters a nonlast disjunct,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point at the start of the next disjunct, and
        <li>
        and sets the redoip slot of the top frame (which is this frame)
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    When the code generator enters the last disjunct,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it does not push any entry on the resume point stack, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame (which is this frame)
        to the main continuation of the resume point
        that was initially on top of the stack.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    In this case, the disjunction hijacks its own frame
    without having to save the value in the hijacked slot.
    We call this a quarter hijack, since it involves one restore.
    <p>
</ul>

<p>
For all the hijacking cases,
the choices represented by the hijacked redoip and maybe redofr slots
cannot be backtracked to
until the disjunction that we are generating code for has failed.
This cannot happen until the last disjunct has failed,
by which time the slots must have been restored.
This maintains the invariant that
for any nondet stack frame whose address is frame_addr,
redofr_slot(frame_addr) == frame_addr whenever curfr == frame_addr.

<h3>Handling semi or det disjunctions</h3>

When the code generator enters a nonlast disjunct,
it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
indicating the resume point at the start of the next disjunct.
When the code generator enters the last disjunct,
it does not push any entry on the resume point stack.

<h2>Handling if-then-elses</h2>

<h3>Handling nondet if-then-elses with nondet conditions</h3>

<ul>
<li> No-hijack case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before the code generator enters the condition, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        creates a temporary nondet stack frame, and
        <li>
        saves the address of this temporary frame in a stack slot.
        <li>
        It also pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point at the start of the else part, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame
        (which must be the temporary frame)
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    After the code generator emerges from the condition,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pops the new entry off the resume point stack.
        </ul>
    <li>
    Before entry to the then part or to the else part, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        assigns do_fail to the redoip slot of the temporary frame
        (pointed to by the stack slot),
        effectively removing the temporary frame.
        (We cannot generate code to pop the frame off the stack,
        since it may not be on top.)
        </ul>
    </ul>
<p>
<li> Worst case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before entering the if-then-else, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        saves in three stack slots
        the address of the top frame (which is in maxfr),
        and the contents of the redoip and redofr slots of the top frame
        (which may be different from this frame).
        <li>
        It also sets the redofr slot of the top frame from curfr,
        so that backtracking through the redoip slot of that frame
        will set curfr to point to this frame.
        </ul>
    <li>
    Before the code generator enters the condition,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point at the start of the else part, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    After the code generator emerges from the condition,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pops the new entry off the resume point stack.
        </ul>
    <li>
    Before entry to the then part or to the else part, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        resets the redoip and redofr slots
        of the frame it hijacked to their saved values.
        Since maxfr may have been changed by the condition pushing new frames,
        the address of the frame in which the restoration is to be performed
        is given by the saved original value of maxfr
        (although on entry to the else part maxfr will be equal to its value
        on entry to the if-then-else, which may be different from curfr).
        </ul>
    </ul>
<p>
<li> Middle case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before entering the if-then-else, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        saves in a stack slot
        the contents of the redoip of the top frame (which must be this frame).

    <li>
    Before the code generator enters the condition,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point at the start of the else part, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.

    <li>
    After the code generator emerges from the condition,

        <ul>
        <li>
        resets the redoip slot of the frame it hijacked (pointed to by curfr)
        to its saved value.
        </ul>
    </ul>
<p>
<li> Best case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before the code generator enters the condition,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point at the start of the else part, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame (which must be this frame)
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    After the code generator emerges from the condition, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        pops the new entry off the resume point stack.
        </ul>
    <li>
    Before entry to the then part or to the else part, the code generator
        <ul>
        <li>
        resets the redoip slot of the frame it hijacked (pointed to by curfr)
        to the stack label of the exposed top entry of the resume point stack.
        If that entry has no stack label,
        then that resume point will never be reached via redo(),
        and thus we do not need to reset the redoip slot.
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
All these four manipulate the redoip slot of the nondet stack frame
that is on top of the nondet stack when execution enters the condition.
On entry to the condition,
we set it to point the start of the else part;
on exit from the condition,
we reset it to some other value to prevent backtracking to the else part.
If the condition hijacks this slot, this scheme will not work.
(Although the code that hijacks the slot
will restore it to its original value before finally failing,
that is too late in this case.)
Therefore before entering the condition,
the code generator sets condition_environment to inside_non_condition; 
on exit from the condition, it restores the original value.
(These are the only times the value of condition_environment is ever changed.)
<p>
Before entering the condition,
the code generator will set resume_point_known to known,
since the resumption point to go to on failure of the condition is known
(it is the start of the else part).
However, this resumption point does not apply to failures in the then part.
Therefore before entering the then
part, the code generator will reset resume_point_known
to the value it had before entering the if-then-else,
except if resume_point_known has become unknown
during the generation of code for the condition,
in which case it will continue to be unknown.
<p>
A failure inside the condition should cause
a branch to the start of the else case
only if the condition has not already succeeded.
In general, the code inside the condition
may branch directly to the start of the else case
only up to the first goal that can succeed more than once;
any other goal following such a goal should branch through the redoip slot
on which the if-then-else performs the soft cut.
<p>
There are only two kinds of constructs that can succeed more than once:
calls (including higher order and method calls) and disjunctions.
When the code generator processes a call that can succeed more than once,
it sets resume_point_known to unknown,
which causes later failures to perform a redo.
To ensure that code in the last disjunct of a model_non disjunction
and code following a model_non disjunction also fail via a redo,
the code generator will,
on entering the last disjunct of a model_non disjunction,
check whether condition_environment is inside_non_condition,
and if yes, it will set resume_point_known to unknown.
(We do not do this in disjuncts other than the last
because non-last disjuncts fail to the start of the next disjunct).
Since at the end of branched control structures such as disjunctions
the code generator sets resume_point_known to unknown
if resume_point_known was unknown at the end of any branch,
this ensures that resume_point_known will stay unknown after the disjunction.
(The end of branched control structures
treat the curfr_vs_maxfr subfield similarly, i.e. set it to may_be_different
if it was may_be_different at the end of any branch.
The condition_environment subfield must, by construction,
have the same value at the end of every branch,
and this is the value it will have after the branched control structure.)

<h3>Handling nondet if-then-elses with semi or det conditions</h3>

We can handle these as we handle nondet if-then-elses with nondet conditions,
or we can handle them as we handle semi or det if-then-elses, with the
exception that we generate the then part and the else part as nondet goals.
The latter is more efficient, so that is what we do.

<h3>Handling semi or det if-then-elses</h3>

Before the code generator enters the condition,
it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
indicating the resume point at the start of the else part,
to the stack continuation in that resume point.
After the code generator emerges from the condition,
it pops the new entry off the resume point stack.

<h2>Handling negations</h2>

We handle not(G) as (if G then fail else true).

<h2>Handling commits</h2>

<h3>Handling commits across nondet goals</h3>

<ul>
<li> No-hijack case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before the code generator enters a goal that is being committed across,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it saves the value of maxfr in a stack slot, and then
        <li>
        it creates a temporary nondet stack frame
        whose redoip slot points to the resume point
        for getting control back if the goal has no solutions.
        <li>
        It also pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating this resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    As for the success and failure continuations:
        <ul>
        <li>
        The code at the resume point created above
        will perform a failure in the manner appropriate
        for whatever entry was originally on top of the resume point stack.
        <li>
        Both continuations will reset maxfr
        to the value it had originally, which is in that stack slot.
        </ul>
    </ul>
<p>
<li> Worst case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before the code generator enters a goal that is being committed across,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it saves the value of maxfr,
        <li>
        pushes a new entry on the resume point stack indicating
        the resume point for getting control back if the goal has no solutions,
        <li>
        saves the values of the redoip and redofr slots of the top frame
        (which may be different from this frame),
        <li>
        overrides the redoip slot to make it point
        to the stack continuation in the resume point, and
        <li>
        also overrides the redofr slot to point to this frame.
        </ul>
    <li>
    As for the success and failure continuations:
        <ul>
        <li>
        The success continuation will reset maxfr;
        the failure continuation doesn't have to
        (since the resume point can only be reached
        if all other frames above the one hijacked have failed.)
        <li>
        Both continuations will reset
        the redoip and redofr slots of the top frame to their saved values.
        <li>
        The failure continuation will then perform a failure in the manner
        appropriate for the values of the resume point stack and left context
        that were current before the commit.
        </ul>
        The order of actions in the success continuation is important,
        since resetting maxfr affects which frame is top.
    </ul>
<p>
<li> Middle case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before the code generator enters a goal that is being committed across,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack,
        indicating the resume point for getting control back
        if the goal has no solutions,
        <li>
        saves the value of the redoip slot of the top frame
        (which is this frame), and
        <li>
        overrides this redoip slot to make it point
        to the stack continuation in the resume point.
        </ul>
    As for the success and failure continuations:
        <ul>
        <li>
        The success continuation will reset maxfr to curfr;
        the failure continuation doesn't have to
        (since the resume point can only be reached
        if all other frames above the one hijacked have failed.)
        <li>
        Both continuations will reset the redoip slot of the top frame
        to the saved value.
        <li>
        The failure continuation will then
        perform a failure in the manner appropriate
        for the values of the resume point stack and left context
        that were current before the commit.
        </ul>
        The order of actions in the success continuation is important,
        since resetting maxfr affects which frame is top.
    </ul>
<p>
<li> Best case.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Before the code generator enters a goal that is being committed across,
        <ul>
        <li>
        it pushes a new entry on the resume point stack
        indicating the resume point for getting control back
        if the goal has no solutions, and
        <li>
        sets the redoip slot of the top frame (which is this frame)
        to the stack continuation in that resume point.
        </ul>
    <li>
    As for the success and failure continuations:
        <ul>
        <li>
        The code at the resume point created above
        will perform a failure in the manner appropriate
        for whatever entry was originally on top of the resume point stack.
        <li>
        The code after the goal in the success continuation
        will reset maxfr to the value it had originally, which is in curfr.
        <li>
        Both continuations will reset the redoip slot of the current frame
        to its original value,
        which is the address of the stack label
        in the originally top failure continuation.
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Since we are cutting away any frames
created by the goal being committed across,
and since any resumption points established in that goal
cannot survive across the commit,
at the end of processing the commit
we can reset both curfr_maxfr and resume_point_known
to their values before the commit.
<p>
We do not need to push a junk frame
when entering the goal to be committed across
even if this goal may perform a hijacking.
If the goal fails, either it did not do any hijacking,
or it will have restored anything it hijacked before failing.
If the goal succeeds, it may have hijacked the top frame,
but we since we do not need to preserve any further solutions inside the goal,
we can simply restore that frame to its original contents anyway.

<h3>Handling commits across multi goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>
If curfr_maxfr is must_be_equal,
the code after the goal will reset maxfr to curfr.
<li>
If curfr_maxfr is may_be_different,
then before the code generator enters a goal that is being committed across,
it saves the value of maxfr in a stack slot.
The code after the goal will reset maxfr to the saved value.
</ul>

<p>
This is the way the code generator handles commits across nondet goals,
except that we do not need to handle
any failure of the goal being committed across,
and thus do not need to set any redoips or hijack anything.

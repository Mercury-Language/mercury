<h2> Summary of Bytecodes </h2>

<p>

Note: Currently we specify only the static layout of bytecodes.
We also need to specify the operational semantics of the bytecodes,
which can be done by specifying state transitions on the abstract
machine. That is, to specify the meaning of a bytecode, we simply
say how the state of the abstract machine has changed from before
interpreting the bytecode to after interpreting the bytecode.

<p>

<ul>
<li> enter_pred (0)
	<ul>
	<li> predicate name (cstring)
	<li> number of procedures in predicate (short)
	</ul>

<li> endof_pred (1)

<li> enter_proc (2)
	<ul>
	<li> procedure id (byte) <br>
		procedure id is used to distinguish the procedures
		in a predicate. <br>
		XXX: should use short instead?
	<li> determinism of the procedure (determinism)
	<li> label count (short) <br>
		Number of labels in the procedure. Used for allocating a
		table of labels in the interpreter.
	<li> temp count (short) <br>
		Number of temporary variables needed for this procedure. (?)
	<li> length of list (short) <br>
		Number of items in next arg
	<li> list of
		<ul>
		<li> Variable info (cstring)
		</ul>
		XXX: we should also have typeinfo for each variable.
	</ul>

<li> endof_proc (3)

<li> label (4)
	<ul>
	<li> Code label. (short)
	</ul>
	Used for jumps, switches, if-then-else, etc.

<li> enter_disjunction (5)
	<ul>
	- label id (short) <br>
		Label refers to the label immediately after the disjunction.
	</ul>

<li> endof_disjunction (6)

<li> enter_disjunct (7)
	<ul>
	<li> label id (short) <br>
		Label refers to label for next disjunct.
	</ul>

<li> endof_disjunct (8)
	<ul>
	<li> label id (short) <br>
		Label refers to label for next disjunct.(?)
		Is -1 if there is no next disjunct in this disjunction.
	</ul>

<li> enter_switch (9)
	<ul>
	<li> variable in slots on which we are switching (short)
	<li> label immediately after the switch (short)
	</ul>
	We jump to the label after we've performed the switch.
		label refers to label immediately after corresponding
		endof_switch.

<li> endof_switch (10)

<li> enter_switch_arm (11)
	<ul>
	<li> constructor id (cons_id)
	<li> label id (short)  <br>
		label refers to label for next switch arm.
	</ul>
			
<li> endof_switch_arm (12) 
	<ul>
	<li> label id (short)
		Label id refers to label immediately before next switch arm. 
		(?)
	</ul>

<li> enter_if (13)
	<ul>
	<li> else label id (short)
	<li> follow label id (short) <br>
		label refers to label at endof_if
		Note that we must've pushed a failure context
		before entering the enter_if. If the condition
		fails, we follow the failure context.
	<li> frame pointer tmp (short) <br>
		XXX: hmm... dunno..
	</ul>


<li> enter_then (14)
	<ul>
	<li> frame pointer temp (short) <br>
		XXX: what's this for?
	</ul>
	XXX: should have flag here? [I wrote this note in a meeting.
	What in hell did I mean?]

<li> endof_then (15) XXX: enter_else is a better name.
	<ul>
	<li> follow label (short) <br>
		XXX: label just before endof_if ???
	</ul>

<li> endof_if (16)

<li> enter_negation (17)
	<ul>
	<li> label id (short)
	</ul>
		label refers to label at endof_negation.
		Note: As with if-then-else, we must push a failure
		context just before entering enter_negation. If the
		negation fails, we follow the failure context.

<li> endof_negation (18)

<li> enter_commit (19)
	<ul>
	- temp (short) <br>
		XXX: what's this for?
	</ul>
	XXX: how does this work?

<li> endof_commit (20)
	<ul>
	<li> temp (short) <br>
		XXX: what's this for?
	</ul>

<li> assign (21)
	<ul>
	<li> Variable A in slots (short)
	<li> Variable B in slots (short)
	</ul>
	A := B. Copy contents of slot B to slot A.

<li> test (22)
	<ul>
	<li> Variable A in slots (short)
	<li> Variable B in slots (short)
	</ul>
	Used to test atomic values (int, float, etc). Before entering
	test, a failure context must be pushed. If the test fails,
	the failure context is followed.
	

<li> construct (23)
	<ul>
	<li> variable slot (short)
	<li> constructor id (cons_id)
	<li> list length of next arg (short)
	<li> list of:
		<ul>
		<li> variable slot (short)
		</ul>
	</ul>
	Apply constructor to list of arguments (in list of variable slots)
	and store result in a variable slot.

<li> deconstruct (24)
	<ul>
	<li> variable slot Var (short)
	<li> constructor id (cons_id)
	<li> list length of next arg (short)
	<li> list of:
		<ul>
		<li> variable slot (short)
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>

	If cons_id is:
		<dl>
		<dt> a functor applied to some args, 
			<dd>
			then remove functor and put args into variable slots.
		<dt> an integer constant, 
			<dd>
			then check for equality of the constant and the 
			value in the variable slot
		<dt> a float constant, 
			<dd>
			then check for equality of the constant and the 
			value in the variable slot.
		<dt> anything else, 
			<dd>
			then makes no sense and interpreter should 
			raise error. <br>
			XXX: correct? 
		</dl>

	<p>

	Note: We must push a failure context before entering deconstruct.			If the deconstruct fails (i.e. functor of Var isn't
		the same as cons_id, or ints are not equal, or floats are
		not equal), then we must follow the failure context.

<li> complex_construct (25)
	<ul>
	<li> var (short)
	<li> cons id (cons_id)
	<li> list length (short)
	<li> list of:
		<ul>
		<li> var (short)
		<li> direction (dir)
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
	This used for general unification using partially instantiated
	terms. This is made possible by bromage's aliasing work.

<li> complex_deconstruct (26)
	<ul>
	<li> variable slot (short)
	<li> constructor id (cons_id)
	<li> list length of next arg (short)
	<li> list of
		<ul>
		<li> variable slot (short)
		<li> direction (dir)
		</ul>
	</ul>
	Note: This is a generalised deconstruct. The directions specify
	which way bindings move. XXX: This is still not 100% crystal clear.

<li> place_arg (27)
	<ul>
	<li> register number (byte)  <br>
		XXX: Do we have at most 256 registers?
	<li> variable number (short)
	</ul>
	Move number from variable slot to register.
	(Note: See notes for pickup_arg.) <p>

	XXX: We will need to #include imp.h from ther Mercury runtime,
	since this specifies the usage of registers. For example, we
	need to know whether we're using the compact or non-compact
	register allocation method for parameter passing. (The compact
	method reuses input registers as output registers. In the 
	non-compact mode, input and output registers are distinct.)

<li> pickup_arg (28)
	<ul>
	<li> register number (byte)
	<li> variable number in variable slots (short)
	</ul>
	Move argument from register to variable slot. <p>

	(Note: We currently don't make use of floating-point registers.
	The datatype for pickup_arg in the bytecode generator allows
	for distinguishing register `types', that is floating-point
	register or normal registers. We may later want to spit out
	another byte `r' or `f' to identify the type of register.)



<li> call (29)
	<ul>
	<li> module id (cstring)
	<li> predicate id (cstring)
	<li> arity (short)
	<li> procedure id (byte)
	</ul>
	XXX: If we call a Mercury builtin, the module name is `mercury_builtin'.
	What if the user has a module called mercury_builtin?

<li> higher_order_call (30)
	<ul>
	<li> var (short)
	<li> input variable count (short)
	<li> output variable count (short)
	<li> determinism (determinism)
	</ul>

<li> builtin_binop (31)
	<ul>
	<li> binary operator (byte) <br>
		This single byte is an index into a table of binary
		operators.
	<li> argument to binary operator (op_arg)
	<li> another argument to binary operator (op_arg)
	<li> variable slot which receives result of binary operation (short)
	</ul>
	XXX: Floating point operations must be distinguished from
	int operations. In the interpreter, we should use a lookup table 
	that maps bytes to the operations.

<li> builtin_unop (32)
	<ul>
	<li> unary operator (byte)
		An index into a table of unary operators.
	<li> argument to unary operator (op_arg)
	<li> variable slot which receives result of unary operation (short)
	</ul>

<li> builtin_bintest (33)
	<ul>
	<li> binary operator (byte)
		An index into a table of binary operators.
	<li> argument to binary test (op_arg)
	<li> another argument to binary test op_arg)
	</ul>
	Note we must first push a choice point which we may follow should
	the test fail.

<li> builtin_untest (34)
	<ul>
	<li> unary operator (byte)
		An index into a tabler of unary operators.
	<li> argument to unary operator (op_arg)
	</ul>
	Note we must first push a choice point which we may follow should
	the test fail.

<li> semidet_succeed (35)

<li> semidet_success_check (36)

<li> fail (37)

<li> context (38)
	<ul>
	<li> line number in Mercury source that the current bytecode
		line corresponds to. (short)
	</ul>
	XXX: Still not clear how we should implement `step' in a debugger
	since a single context may have other contexts interleaved in it.

<li> not_supported (39)
	<p>

	Some unsupported feature is used. Inline C in Mercury code,
	for instance. Any procedure thatr contains inline C
	(or is compiled Mercury?) must have the format:
		<ul>
		<li> enter_pred ...
		<li> not_supported
		<li> endof_pred
		</ul>

</ul>

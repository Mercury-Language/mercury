	Notes On The Design Of The Mercury Compiler
</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<hr>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

This file contains an overview of the design of the compiler.

See also <a href="overall_design.html">overall_design.html</a>
for an overview of how the different sub-systems (compiler,
library, runtime, etc.) fit together.

<hr>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2> OUTLINE </h2>

<p>

The main job of the compiler is to translate Mercury into C, although it
can also translate (subsets of) Mercury to some other languages:
Mercury bytecode (for a planned bytecode interpreter), MSIL (for the
Microsoft .NET platform) and RL (the Aditi Relational Language).

<p>

The top-level of the compiler is in the file mercury_compile.m.
The basic design is that compilation is broken into the following
stages:

<ul>
<li> 1. parsing (source files -&gt; HLDS)
<li> 2. semantic analysis and error checking (HLDS -&gt; annotated HLDS)
<li> 3. high-level transformations (annotated HLDS -&gt; annotated HLDS)
<li> 4. code generation (annotated HLDS -&gt; target representation)
<li> 5. low-level optimizations
     (target representation -&gt; target representation)
<li> 6. output code (target representation -&gt; target code)
</ul>

Note that in reality the separation is not quite as simple as that.
Although parsing is listed as step 1 and semantic analysis is listed
as step 2, the last stage of parsing actually includes some semantic checks.
And although optimization is listed as steps 3 and 5, it also occurs in
steps 2, 4, and 6.  For example, elimination of assignments to dead
variables is done in mode analysis; middle-recursion optimization and
the use of static constants for ground terms is done in code
generation; and a few low-level optimizations are done in llds_out.m
as we are spitting out the C code.

<p>

In addition, the compiler is actually a multi-targeted compiler
with several different back-ends.  When you take the different
back-ends into account, the structure looks like this:

<ul type=disc>
<li> front-end
     <ul type=disc>
     <li> 1. parsing (source files -&gt; HLDS)
     <li> 2. semantic analysis and error checking (HLDS -&gt; annotated HLDS)
     <li> 3. high-level transformations (annotated HLDS -&gt; annotated HLDS)
     </ul>
<li> back-ends
     <ul type=disc>
     <li> a. LLDS back-end
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> 4a. code generation (annotated HLDS -&gt; LLDS)
          <li> 5a. low-level optimizations (LLDS -&gt; LLDS)
          <li> 6a. output code (LLDS -&gt; C)
          </ul>
     <li> b. MLDS back-end
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> 4b. code generation (annotated HLDS -&gt; MLDS)
          <li> 5b. MLDS transformations (MLDS -&gt; MLDS)
          <li> 6b. output code
	       (MLDS -&gt; C or MLDS -&gt; MSIL
	       or eventually MLDS -&gt; Java, etc.)
          </ul>
     <li> c. RL back-end
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> 4c. code generation (annotated HLDS -&gt; RL)
          <li> 5c. low-level optimizations (RL -&gt; RL)
          <li> 6c. output code (RL -&gt; RL-bytecode)
          </ul>
     <li> d. bytecode back-end
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> 4d. code generation (annotated HLDS -&gt; bytecode)
          </ul>
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2> DETAILED DESIGN </h2>

This section describes the role of each module in the compiler.
For more information about the design of a particular module,
see the documentation at the start of that module's source code.

<p>
<hr>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>

The action is co-ordinated from mercury_compile.m or make.m (if `--make'
was specified on the command line).

<p>

<h3> Option handling </h3>

<p>

The command-line options are defined in the module options.m.
mercury_compile.m calls library/getopt.m, passing the predicates
defined in options.m as arguments, to parse them.  It then invokes
handle_options.m to postprocess the option set.  The results are
stored in the io__state, using the type globals defined in globals.m.
After the options are processed, the options files specified
by the `--option-defaults-file' option is read by options_file.m.
The options are then reprocessed with the options set in the options
file.

<p>

<h3> Build system </h3>

<p>

<dl> 

<dt> make.m
	<dd> 
	Categorizes targets passed on the command line and passes
	them to the appropriate module to be built.

<dt> make.program_target.m
	<dd>
	Handles whole program `mmc --make' targets, including
	executables, libraries and cleanup.

<dt> make.module_target.m
	<dd>
	Handles targets built by a compilation action associated 
	with a single module, for example making interface files,

<dt> make.dependencies.m
	<dd>
	Compute dependencies between targets and between modules.

<dt> make.module_dep_file.m
	<dd>
	Record the dependency information for each module between
	compilations.

<dt> make.util.m
	<dd>
	Utility predicates.

</dl>

<p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3> FRONT END </h3>
<h4> 1. Parsing </h4>

<p>

<ul>

<li> lexical analysis (library/lexer.m)

<li> stage 1 parsing - convert strings to terms. <br>

	library/parser.m contains the code to do this, while
	library/term.m and library/varset.m contain the term and varset
	data structures that result, and predicates for manipulating them.

<li> stage 2 parsing - convert terms to `items' (declarations, clauses, etc.) 
	<br>

	The result of this stage is a parse tree that has a one-to-one
	correspondence with the source code.  The parse tree data structure
	definition is in prog_data.m, while the code to create it is in
	prog_io.m and its submodules prog_io_dcg.m (which handles clauses
	using Definite Clause Grammar notation), prog_io_goal.m (which handles
	goals), prog_io_pragma.m (which handles pragma declarations),
	prog_io_typeclass.m (which handles typeclass and instance declarations)
	and prog_io_util.m (which defines predicates and types needed by the
	other prog_io*.m modules.  The data structure for insts is stored in 
	its own module, inst.m.
	
	<p>

	The modules prog_out.m and mercury_to_mercury.m contain predicates
	for printing the parse tree.  prog_util.m contains some utility
	predicates for manipulating the parse tree.

<li> imports and exports are handled at this point (modules.m) <br>

	modules.m has the code to write out `.int', `.int2', `.int3',
	`.d' and `.dep' files.

<li> module qualification of types, insts and modes <br>

	module_qual.m -  <br>
	Adds module qualifiers to all types insts and modes,
	checking that a given type, inst or mode exists and that 
	there is only possible match.  This is done here because 
	it must be done before the `.int' and `.int2' interface files
	are written. This also checks whether imports are really needed
	in the interface.
	<br>
 	Notes on module qualification:
	<ul>
	<li> all types, typeclasses, insts and modes occuring in pred, func,
	  type, typeclass and mode declarations are module qualified by
	  module_qual.m.
 	<li> all types, insts and modes occuring in lambda expressions,
 	  explicit type qualifications, and clause mode annotations
	  are module qualified in make_hlds.m.
 	<li> constructors occuring in predicate and function mode declarations
 	  are module qualified during type checking.
 	<li> predicate and function calls and constructors within goals 
 	  are module qualified during mode analysis.
	</ul>
 

<li> reading and writing of optimization interfaces
     (intermod.m and trans_opt.m). <br>
	
	&lt;module&gt;.opt contains clauses for exported preds suitable for
	inlining or higher-order specialization. The `.opt' file for the
	current module is written after type-checking. `.opt' files
	for imported modules are read here.
	&lt;module&gt;.opt contains termination analysis information
	for exported preds (eventually it ought to contain other
	"transitive" information too, e.g. for optimization, but
	currently it is only used for termination analysis).
	`.trans_opt' files for imported modules are read here.
	The `.trans_opt' file for the current module is written
	after the end of semantic analysis.

<li> expansion of equivalence types (equiv_type.m) <br>

	This is really part of type-checking, but is done
	on the item_list rather than on the HLDS because it
	turned out to be much easier to implement that way.

<li> conversion to superhomogeneous form and into HLDS <br>

	make_hlds.m transforms the code into superhomogeneous form,
	and at the same time converts the parse tree into the HLDS.
	It expands away universal quantification
	(using `all [Vs] G' ===> `not (some [Vs] (not G))')
	and implication (using `A => B' ===> `not(A, not B)').
	It converts `pragma import', `pragma c_code' and `pragma fact_table'
	declarations into clauses with HLDS `pragma_c_code'
	instructions for bodies.
	The `pragma fact_table' conversion is done by calling fact_table.m
	which also reads the facts from the declared file and compiles them
	into a separate C file for which the `pragma_c_code' contains lookup
	code.
	make_hlds.m also calls make_tags.m which chooses the data
	representation for each discriminated union type by
	assigning tags to each functor.
</ul>

<p>

The result at this stage is the High Level Data Structure,
which is defined in four files:

<ol>
<li> hlds_data.m defines the parts of the HLDS concerned with
	  function symbols, types, insts, modes and determinisms;
<li> hlds_goal.m defines the part of the HLDS concerned with the
	  structure of goals, including the annotations on goals;
<li> hlds_pred.m defines the part of the HLDS concerning
	  predicates and procedures;
<li> hlds_module.m defines the top-level parts of the HLDS,
	  including the type module_info.
</ol>

The module hlds_out.m contains predicates to dump the HLDS to a file.
The module goal_util.m contains predicates for renaming variables
in an HLDS goal.

<p>

<h4> 2. Semantic analysis and error checking </h4>

<p>

Any pass which can report errors or warnings must be part of this stage,
so that the compiler does the right thing for options such as
`--halt-at-warn' (which turns warnings into errors) and
`--error-check-only' (which makes the compiler only compile up to this stage).

<p>

<dl>

<dt> implicit quantification

	<dd>
	quantification.m handles implicit quantification and computes
	the set of non-local variables for each sub-goal.
	It also expands away bi-implication (unlike the expansion
	of implication and universal quantification, this expansion
	cannot be done until after quantification).
	This pass is called from the `transform' predicate in make_hlds.m.

<dt> checking typeclass instances (check_typeclass.m)
	<dd>
	check_typeclass.m both checks that instance declarations satisfy all 
	the appropriate superclass constraints and
	performs a source-to-source transformation on the
	methods methods from the instance declarations.
	The transformed code is checked for type, mode, uniqueness, purity
	and determinism correctness by the later passes, which has the effect
	of checking the correctness of the instance methods themselves
	(ie. that the instance methods match those expected by the typeclass
	declaration).
	During the transformation,
	pred_ids and proc_ids are assigned to the methods for each instance. 

	In
	addition, while checking that the superclasses of a class are satisfied
	by the instance declaration, a set of constraint_proofs are built up 
	for the superclass constraints. These are used by polymorphism.m when
	generating the base_typeclass_info for the instance.

<dt> type checking

	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li> typecheck.m handles type checking, overloading resolution &
	  module name resolution, and almost fully qualifies all predicate
	  and functor names.  It sets the map(var, type) field in the
	  pred_info.  However, typecheck.m doesn't figure out the pred_id
	  for function calls or calls to overloaded predicates; that can't
	  be done in a single pass of typechecking, and so it is done
	  later on (in post_typecheck.m, for both preds and function calls)
	  Typeclass constraints are checked here, and
	  any redundant constraints that are eliminated are recorded (as
	  constraint_proofs) in the pred_info for future reference. When it has
	  finished, typecheck.m calls clause_to_proc.m to make duplicate copies
	  of the clauses for each different mode of a predicate; all later
	  stages work on procedures, not predicates.
	<li> type_util.m contains utility predicates dealing with types
	  that are used in a variety of different places within the compiler
	<li> post_typecheck.m may also be considered to logically be a part
	  of typechecking, but it is actually called from purity
	  analysis (see below).  It contains the stuff related to
	  type checking that can't be done in the main type checking pass.
	  It also removes assertions from further processing.
	</ul>

<dt> assertions

	<dd>
	assertion.m is the abstract interface to the assertion table.
	Currently all the compiler does is type check the assertions and
	record for each predicate that is used in an assertion, which
	assertion it is used in.  The set up of the assertion table occurs
	in post_typecheck__finish_assertion.

<dt> purity analysis
	
	<dd>
	purity.m is responsible for purity checking, as well as
	defining the <CODE>purity</CODE> type and a few public
	operations on it.  It also calls post_typecheck.m to
	complete the handling of predicate
	overloading for cases which typecheck.m is unable to handle,
	and to check for unbound type variables.
	Elimination of double negation is also done here; that needs to
	be done after quantification analysis and before mode analysis.

<dt> polymorphism transformation

	<dd>
	polymorphism.m handles introduction of type_info arguments for
	polymorphic predicates and introduction of typeclass_info arguments
	for typeclass-constrained predicates.
	This phase needs to come before mode analysis so that mode analysis
	can properly reorder code involving existential types.
	(It also needs to come before simplification so that simplify.m's
	optimization of goals with no output variables doesn't do the
	wrong thing for goals whose only output is the type_info for 
	an existentially quantified type parameter.)
	<p>
	This phase also 
	converts higher-order predicate terms into lambda expressions,
	and copies the clauses to the proc_infos in preparation for
	mode analysis.
	<p>
	The polymorphism.m module also exports some utility routines that
	are used by other modules.  These include some routines for generating
	code to create type_infos, which are used by simplify.m and magic.m
	when those modules introduce new calls to polymorphic procedures.

<dt> mode analysis

	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li> modes.m is the main mode analysis module.  
	  It checks that the code is mode-correct, reordering it
	  if necessary, and annotates each goal with a delta-instmap
	  that specifies the changes in instantiatedness of each
	  variable over that goal.
	<li> modecheck_unify.m is the sub-module which analyses
	  unification goals.
	  It also module qualifies data constructors.
	<li> modecheck_call.m is the sub-module which analyses calls.

		<p>

	  The following sub-modules are used:
		<dl>
		<dt> mode_info.m 
			<dd>
			(the main data structure for mode analysis)
		<dt> delay_info.m 
			<dd>
			(a sub-component of the mode_info data
			structure used for storing the information
			for scheduling: which goals are currently
			delayed, what variables they are delayed on, etc.)
		<dt> instmap.m
			<dd>
			Defines the instmap and instmap_delta ADTs
			which store information on what instantiations
			a set of variables may be bound to.
		<dt> inst_match.m
			<dd>
			This contains the code for examining insts and
			checking whether they match.
		<dt> inst_util.m
			<dd>
			This contains the code for creating new insts from
			old ones: unifying them, merging them and so on.
		<dt> mode_errors.m
			<dd>
			This module contains all the code to
			print error messages for mode errors
		</dl>
	<li> mode_util.m contains miscellaneous useful predicates dealing
	  with modes (many of these are used by lots of later stages
	  of the compiler)
	<li> mode_debug.m contains utility code for tracing the actions
	  of the mode checker.
	</ul>

<dt> indexing and determinism analysis
 
	<dd>
	<ul>
	<li> switch_detection.m transforms into switches those disjunctions
	  in which several disjuncts test the same variable against different
	  function symbols.
	<li> cse_detection.m looks for disjunctions in which each disjunct tests
	  the same variable against the same function symbols, and hoists any
	  such unifications out of the disjunction.
	  If cse_detection.m modifies the code,
	  it will re-run mode analysis and switch detection.
	<li> det_analysis.m annotates each goal with its determinism;
	  it inserts cuts in the form of "some" goals wherever the determinisms
	  and delta instantiations of the goals involved make it necessary.
	  Any errors found during determinism analysis are reported by
	  det_report.m.
	  Det_util.m contains utility predicates used in several modules.
	</ul>

<dt> checking of unique modes (unique_modes.m)

	<dd>
	unique_modes.m checks that non-backtrackable unique modes were
	not used in a context which might require backtracking.
	Note that what unique_modes.m does is quite similar to
	what modes.m does, and unique_modes calls lots of predicates
	defined in modes.m to do it.

<dt> stratification checking

	<dd>
	The module stratify.m implements the `--warn-non-stratification'
	warning, which is an optional warning that checks for loops
	through negation.

<dt> simplification (simplify.m)

	<dd>
	simplify.m finds and exploits opportunities for simplifying the
	internal form of the program, both to optimize the code and to
	massage the code into a form the code generator will accept.
	It also warns the programmer about any constructs that are so simple
	that they should not have been included in the program in the first
	place.  (That's why this pass needs to be part of semantic analysis:
	because it can report warnings.)
	simplify.m converts complicated unifications into procedure calls.
	simplify.m calls common.m which looks for (a) construction unifications
	that construct a term that is the same as one that already exists,
	or (b) repeated calls to a predicate with the same inputs, and replaces
	them with assignment unifications.
	simplify.m also attempts to partially evaluate calls to builtin
	procedures if the inputs are all constants (see const_prop.m),

</dl>

<h4> 3. High-level transformations </h4>

<p>

The first pass of this stage does tabling transformations (table_gen.m). 
This involves the insertion of several calls to tabling predicates 
defined in mercury_builtin.m and the addition of some scaffolding structure.
Note that this pass can change the evaluation methods of some procedures to
eval_table_io, so it should come before any passes that require definitive
evaluation methods (e.g. inlining).

<p>

The next pass of this stage is a code simplification, namely
removal of lambda expressions (lambda.m):

<ul>
<li>
	lambda.m converts lambda expressions into higher-order predicate
        terms referring to freshly introduced separate predicates.
	This pass needs to come after unique_modes.m to ensure that
	the modes we give to the introduced predicates are correct.
	It also needs to come after polymorphism.m since polymorphism.m
	doesn't handle higher-order predicate constants.
</ul>

(Is there any good reason why lambda.m comes after table_gen.m?)

<p>

The next pass is termination analysis. The various modules involved are:

<ul>
<li>
termination.m is the control module. It sets the argument size and
termination properties of builtin and compiler generated procedures,
invokes term_pass1.m and term_pass2.m
and writes .trans_opt files and error messages as appropriate.
<li>
term_pass1.m analyzes the argument size properties of user-defined procedures,
<li>
term_pass2.m analyzes the termination properties of user-defined procedures.
<li>
term_traversal.m contains code common to the two passes.
<li>
term_errors.m defines the various kinds of termination errors
and prints the messages appropriate for each.
<li>
term_util.m defines the main types used in termination analysis
and contains utility predicates.
<li>
lp.m is used by term_pass1.m. It implements the Linear Programming
algorithm for optimizing a set of linear constraints with respect to
a linear cost function.
</ul>

<p>

Most of the remaining HLDS-to-HLDS transformations are optimizations:

<ul>
<li> specialization of higher-order and polymorphic predicates where the
  value of the higher-order/type_info/typeclass_info arguments are known
  (higher_order.m)

<li> attempt to introduce accumulators (accumulator.m).  This optimizes
  procedures whose tail consists of independent associative computations
  or independant chains of commutative computations into a tail
  recursive form by the introduction of accumulators.  If lco is turned
  on it can also transform some procedures so that only construction
  unifications are after the recursive call.  This pass must come before
  lco, unused_args (eliminating arguments makes it hard to relate the
  code back to the assertion) and inlining (can make the associative
  call disappear).

<li> inlining (i.e. unfolding) of simple procedures (inlining.m)

<li> deforestation and partial evaluation (deforest.m). This optimizes
  multiple traversals of data structures within a conjunction, and
  avoids creating intermediate data structures. It also performs
  loop unrolling where the clause used is known at compile time.
  deforest.m makes use of the following sub-modules
  (`pd_' stands for "partial deduction"):
  <ul>
  <li>
  constraint.m transforms goals so that goals which can fail
  are executed earlier.
  <li>
  pd_cost.m contains some predicates to estimate the improvement
  caused by deforest.m.
  <li>
  pd_debug.m produces debugging output.
  <li>
  pd_info.m contains a state type for deforestation.
  <li>
  pd_term.m contains predicates to check that the deforestation algorithm
  terminates.
  <li>
  pd_util.m contains various utility predicates.
  </ul>
 
<li> issue warnings about unused arguments from predicates, and create
  specialized versions without them (unused_args.m); type_infos are
  often unused.

<li> delay_construct.m pushes construction unifications to the right in
  semidet conjunctions, in an effort to reduce the probability that it will
  need to be executed.

<li> unneeded_code.m looks for goals whose results are either not needed
  at all, or needed in some branches of computation but not others. Provided
  that the goal in question satisfies some requirements (e.g. it is pure,
  it cannot fail etc), it either deletes the goal or moves it to the
  computation branches where its output is needed.

<li> elimination of dead procedures (dead_proc_elim.m). Inlining, higher-order
  specialization and the elimination of unused args can make procedures dead
  even the user doesn't, and automatically constructed unification and
  comparison predicates are often dead as well.

<li> conversion of Aditi procedures into disjunctive normal form (dnf.m).
  The supplementary magic sets and context transformations are only defined
  for predicates in DNF.

<li> supplementary magic sets or supplementary context transformation of
	Aditi procedures (magic.m, magic_util.m, context.m).
  The magic sets or context transformations must be applied to convert the
  program to a form for which Aditi-RL bytecode can be generated.

<li> reducing the number of variables that have to be saved across
  procedure calls (saved_vars.m). We do this by putting the code that
  generates the value of a variable just before the use of that variable,
  duplicating the variable and the code that produces it if necessary,
  provided the cost of doing so is smaller than the cost of saving and
  restoring the variable would be.

</ul>

<p>

The module transform.m contains stuff that is supposed to be useful
for high-level optimizations (but which is not yet used).

<p>

The last HLDS-to-HLDS transformation implements deep profiling
(deep_profiling.m).

<p>
<hr>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3> a. LLDS BACK-END </h3>

<h4> 4a. Code generation. </h4>

<p>

<dl>
<dt> pre-passes to annotate the HLDS

	<dd>
	Before code generation there are a few more passes which 
	annotate the HLDS with information used for code generation:

		<dl>
		<dt> choosing registers for procedure arguments (arg_info.m)
			<dd>
			Currently uses one of two simple algorithms, but
			we may add other algorithms later.
		<dt> annotation of goals with liveness information (liveness.m)
			<dd>
			This records the birth and death of each variable
			in the HLDS goal_info.
		<dt> allocation of stack slots
			<dd>
			This is done by live_vars.m, which works
			out which variables need to be saved on the
			stack when (trace.m determines what variables
			are needed for debugging purposes).
			It then uses graph_colour.m to determine
			a good allocation of variables to stack slots.
		<dt> migration of builtins following branched structures
			<dd>
			This transformation, which is performed by
			follow_code.m, improves the results of follow_vars.
		<dt> allocating the follow vars (follow_vars.m)
			<dd>
			Traverses backwards over the HLDS, annotating some
			goals with information about what locations variables
			will be needed in next.  This allows us to generate
			more efficient code by putting variables in the right
			spot directly.  This module is not called from
			mercury_compile.m; it is called from store_alloc.m.
		<dt> allocating the store map (store_alloc.m)
			<dd>
			Annotates each branched goal with variable location
			information so that we can generate correct code
			by putting variables in the same spot at the end
			of each branch.
		<dt> computing goal paths (goal_path.m)
			<dd>
			The goal path of a goal defines its position in
			the procedure body. This transformation attaches
			its goal path to every goal, for use by the debugger.
		</dl>

<dt> code generation

	<dd>
	Code generation converts HLDS into LLDS.
	For the LLDS back-end, this is also the point at which we
	insert code to handle debugging and trailing, and to do
	heap reclamation on failure.
	The main code generation module is code_gen.m. 
	It handles conjunctions and negations, but calls sub-modules
	to do most of the other work:

		<ul>
		<li> ite_gen.m (if-then-elses)
		<li> call_gen.m (predicate calls and also calls to
			out-of-line unification procedures)
		<li> disj_gen.m (disjunctions)
		<li> par_conj.m (parallel conjunctions)
		<li> unify_gen.m (unifications)
		<li> switch_gen.m (switches), which has sub-modules
			<ul>
			<li> dense_switch.m
			<li> lookup_switch.m
			<li> string_switch.m
			<li> tag_switch.m
			<li> switch_util.m (also used by MLDS back-end)
			</ul>
		<li> commit_gen.m (commits)
		<li> pragma_c_gen.m (embedded C code)
		</ul>
		<p>

	It also calls middle_rec.m to do middle recursion optimization.

	<p>

	The code generation modules make use of
		<dl>
		<dt> code_info.m
			<dd>
			The main data structure for the code generator.
		<dt> code_exprn.m
			<dd>
			This defines the exprn_info type, which is 
			a sub-component of the code_info data structure
			which holds the information about
			the contents of registers and
			the values/locations of variables.
			It implements lazy code generation.
		<dt> exprn_aux.m
			<dd>
			Various preds which use exprn_info.
		<dt> var_locn.m
			<dd>
			This defines the var_locn type, which is an alternative
			to code_exprn; like code_exprn, it keeps track of
			the values and locations of variables.
			It implements eager code generation.
		<dt> code_util.m
			<dd>
			Some miscellaneous preds used for code generation.
		<dt> code_aux.m
			<dd>
			Some miscellaneous preds which, unlike those in
			code_util, use code_info.
		<dt> continuation_info.m
			<dd>
			For accurate garbage collection, collects
			information about each live value after calls,
			and saves information about procedures.
		<dt> trace.m
			<dd>
			Inserts calls to the runtime debugger.
		</dl>

<dt> code generation for `pragma export' declarations (export.m)
<dd> This is handled seperately from the other parts of code generation.
     mercury_compile.m calls the procedures `export__produce_header_file'
     and `export__get_pragma_exported_procs' to produce C code fragments
     which declare/define the C functions which are the interface stubs
     for procedures exported to C.

<dt> generation of constants for RTTI data structures
<dd> This could also be considered a part of code generation,
     but for the LLDS back-end this is currently done as part
     of the output phase (see below).
</dl>

<p>

The result of code generation is the Low Level Data Structure (llds.m),
which may also contains some data structures whose types are defined in rtti.m.
The code for each procedure is generated as a tree of code fragments
which is then flattened (tree.m).

<p>

<h4> 5a. Low-level optimization (LLDS). </h4>

<p>

The various LLDS-to-LLDS optimizations are invoked from optimize.m.
They are:

<ul>
<li> optimization of jumps to jumps (jumpopt.m)

<li> elimination of duplicate code sequences (dupelim.m)

<li> optimization of stack frame allocation/deallocation (frameopt.m)

<li> filling branch delay slots (delay_slot.m)

<li> dead code and dead label removal (labelopt.m)

<li> peephole optimization (peephole.m)

<li> introduction of local C variables (use_local_vars.m) <br>

</ul>

<p>

Several of these optimizations (frameopt and use_local_vars)
use livemap.m, a module that finds the set of locations live at each label.

Use_local_vars numbering also introduces
references to temporary variables in extended basic blocks
in the LLDS representation of the C code.
The transformation to insert the block scopes
and declare the temporary variables is performed by wrap_blocks.m.

<p>

Depending on which optimization flags are enabled,
optimize.m may invoke many of these passes multiple times.

<p>

Some of the low-level optimization passes use basic_block.m,
which defines predicates for converting sequences of instructions to
basic block format and back, as well as opt_util.m, which contains
miscellaneous predicates for LLDS-to-LLDS optimization.

<p>

<h4> 6a. Output C code </h4>

<ul>
<li> type_ctor_info.m generates the type_ctor_gen_info structures that list
  items of information (including unification, index and compare predicates)
  associated with each declared type constructor that go into the static
  type_ctor_info data structure. If the type_ctor_gen_info structure is not
  eliminated as inaccessible, this module adds the corresponding type_ctor_info
  structure to the RTTI data structures defined in rtti.m,
  which are part of the LLDS.

<li> base_typeclass_info.m generates the base_typeclass_info structures that 
  list the methods of a class for each instance declaration. These are added to
  the RTTI data structures, which are part of the LLDS.

<li> stack_layout.m generates the stack_layout structures for
  accurate garbage collection. Tables are created from the data
  collected in continuation_info.m.

  Stack_layout.m uses prog_rep.m and static_term.m to generate representations
  of procedure bodies for use by the declarative debugger.

<li> Type_ctor_info structures and stack_layout structures both contain
  pseudo_type_infos, which are type_infos with holes for type variables;
  these are generated by pseudo_type_info.m.

<li> llds_common.m extracts static terms from the main body of the LLDS, and
  puts them at the front. If a static term originally appeared several times,
  it will now appear as a single static term with multiple references to it.

<li> transform_llds.m is responsible for doing any source to source
     transformations on the llds which are required to make the C output
     acceptable to various C compilers.  Currently computed gotos can have
     their maximum size limited to avoid a fixed limit in lcc.

<li> Final generation of C code is done in llds_out.m, which subcontracts the
     output of RTTI structures to rtti_out.m.
</ul>

<h3> b. MLDS BACK-END </h3>

The original LLDS code generator generates very low-level code,
since the LLDS was designed to map easily to RISC architectures.
We're currently developing a new back-end that generates much higher-level
code, suitable for generating Java, high-level C, etc.
This back-end uses the Medium Level Data Structure (mlds.m) as its
intermediate representation.

<h4> 3b. pre-passes to annotate/transform the HLDS </h4>

Before code generation there is a pass which annotates the HLDS with
information used for code generation:

<ul>
<li> mark_static_terms.m marks construction unifications
     which can be implemented using static constants rather
     than heap allocation.
</ul>

For the MLDS back-end, we've tried to keep the code generator simple.
So we prefer to do things as HLDS to HLDS transformations where possible,
rather than complicating the HLDS to MLDS code generator.
So we have a pass which transforms the HLDS to handle trailing:

<ul>
<li> add_trail_ops.m inserts code to manipulate the trail,
     in particular ensuring that we apply the appropriate
     trail operations before each choice point, when execution
     resumes after backtracking, and whenever we do a commit.
     The trail operations are represented as (and implemented as)
     calls to impure procedures defined in library/private_builtin.m. 
<li> add_heap_ops.m is very similar to add_trail_ops.m;
     it inserts code to do heap reclamation on backtracking.
</ul>

<h4> 4b. MLDS code generation </h4>
<ul>
<li> ml_code_gen.m converts HLDS code to MLDS.
	  The following sub-modules are used to handle different constructs:
		<dl>
		<dt> ml_unify_gen.m
		<dt> ml_closure_gen.m
		<dt> ml_call_gen.m
		<dt> ml_switch_gen.m, which in turn has sub-modules
			<ul>
			<li> ml_dense_switch.m
			<li> ml_string_switch.m
			<li> ml_tag_switch.m
			<li> switch_util.m (also used by MLDS back-end)
			</ul>
		<dl>
	  The module ml_code_util.m provides utility routines for
	  MLDS code generation.  The module ml_util.m provides some
	  general utility routines for the MLDS.
<li> ml_type_gen.m converts HLDS types to MLDS.
<li> type_ctor_info.m and base_typeclass_info.m generate
     the RTTI data structures defined in rtti.m and pseudo_type_info.m
     (those four modules are shared with the LLDS back-end)
     and then mlds_to_rtti.m converts these to MLDS.
</ul>

<h4> 5b. MLDS transformations </h4>
<ul>
<li> ml_tailcall.m annotates the MLDS with information about tailcalls.
     It also has a pass to implement the `--warn-non-tail-recursion' option.
<li> ml_optimize.m does MLDS-&gt;MLDS optimizations
<li> ml_elim_nested.m does two MLDS transformations that happen
     to have a lot in common: (1) eliminating nested functions
     and (2) adding code to handle accurate garbage collection.
</ul>

<h4> 6b. MLDS output </h4>

There are currently two backends that generate code from MLDS, one
generates C/C++ code, the other generates Microsoft's Intermediate
Language (MSIL or IL).
<p>
<ul>
<li>mlds_to_c.m converts MLDS to C/C++ code.
</ul>
<p>
The MLDS-&gt;IL backend is broken into several submodules.
<ul>
<li> mlds_to_ilasm.m converts MLDS to IL assembler and writes it to a .il file.
<li> mlds_to_il.m converts MLDS to IL 
<li> ilds.m contains representations of IL  
<li> ilasm.m contains output routines for writing IL to assembler.
<li> il_peephole.m performs peephole optimization on IL instructions.
</ul>
After IL assembler has been emitted, ILASM in invoked to turn the .il
file into a .dll or .exe.
<p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3> c. Aditi-RL BACK-END </h3>

<h4> 4c. Aditi-RL generation </h4>

<ul>
<li> rl_gen.m converts HLDS to RL.

<li> rl_relops.m generates RL for relational operations such as joins.

<li> rl_info.m defines a state type.

<li> rl.m defines the the representation of Aditi-RL used within the
Mercury compiler. There are some slight differences between rl.m
and Aditi-RL to make optimization easier.

<li> rl_dump.m contains predicates to write the types defined in rl.m.
</ul>

<h4> 5c. Aditi-RL optimization </h4>

<ul>
<li> rl_opt.m invokes the RL optimization passes.

<li> rl_block.m converts an RL procedure into basic blocks, and performs
  other tasks such as detecting the loops in those basic blocks.

<li> rl_analyse.m contains a generic data-flow analysis procedure for
  RL procedures.

<li> rl_liveness.m uses rl_analyse.m to insert code to initialise relations
  and clear references to them when they are no longer needed.

<li> rl_loop.m moves invariants out of loops.

<li> rl_block_opt.m performs common subexpression elimination and instruction
  merging on basic blocks.

<li> rl_key.m computes upper and lower bounds on the non-locals of a goal
  for which the goal could succeed, which is useful for determining when
  an index could be used for a relational operation.

<li> rl_sort.m introduces sort-merge and indexed versions of relational
  operations where possible, and optimizes away unnecessary sorting and
  indexing.

<li> rl_stream.m detects relations which do not need to be materialised.
</ul>  

<h4> 6c. Output Aditi-RL code </h4>

<ul>
<li> rl_out.m converts from the instructions defined in rl.m
  to bytecode either as data in the &lt;module&gt;.c file or
  to &lt;module&gt;.rlo and outputs a text representation to
  &lt;module&gt;.rla.

<li> rl_exprn.m is called from rl_out.m to convert top down Mercury
  code (in HLDS form) to Aditi bytecode.

<li> rl_code.m contains the definition of the bytecodes interpreted
  by Aditi. This file is automatically generated from the Aditi sources.
 
<li> rl_file.m contains routines to output the bytecodes defined in rl_code.m.
</ul>

<p>
<hr>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3> d. BYTECODE BACK-END </h3>

<p>

The Mercury compiler can translate Mercury programs into bytecode for
interpretation by a bytecode interpreter.  The intent of this is to
achieve faster turn-around time during development.  However, the
bytecode interpreter has not yet been written.

<ul>
<li> bytecode.m defines the internal representation of bytecodes, and contains
  the predicates to emit them in two forms. The raw bytecode form is emitted
  into &lt;filename&gt;.bytecode for interpretation, while a human-readable
  form is emitted into &lt;filename&gt;.bytedebug for visual inspection.

<li> bytecode_gen.m contains the predicates that translate HLDS into bytecode.

<li> bytecode_data.m contains the predicates that translate ints, strings
  and floats into bytecode. This is also used by rl_code.m.
</ul>

<p>
<hr>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3> SMART RECOMPILATION </h3>

<p>

The Mercury compiler can record program dependency information
to avoid unnecessary recompilations when an imported module's
interface changes in a way which does not invalidate previously
compiled code.

<ul>
<li> recompilation.m contains types used by the other smart
  recompilation modules.

<li> recompilation_version.m generates version numbers for program items
  in interface files.

<li> recompilation_usage.m works out which program items were used
  during a compilation.

<li> recompilation_check.m is called before recompiling a module.
  It uses the information written by recompilation_version.m and
  recompilation_usage.m to work out whether the recompilation is
  actually needed.

<li> timestamp.m contains an ADT representing timestamps used
  by smart recompilation.
</ul>

<p>
<hr>

<h3> CURRENTLY USELESS </h3>

<p>

	<dl>

	<dt> lco.m:

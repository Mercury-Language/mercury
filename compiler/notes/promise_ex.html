<h1> Promise Ex Declarations</h1>

This document is a description of promise ex declarations,
which are currently unfinished and as such are undocumented 
in the reference manual.

<!-------------------------->
<h2> Syntax </h2>

There are currently three promise ex declarations: promise_exclusive, 
promise_exhaustive, and promise_exclusive_exhaustive. They are used to 
denote determinism properties of a disjunction, and denote either exclusivity
exhaustiveness or both. The examples of each, given below, also show
the different ways that existential quantification can be handled.

<ul>
<li>	Mutual exclusivity:
	<pre>
	:- all [X, Y] promise_exclusive
		some [Z] ( 
			p(X, Y, Z) 
		; 
			q(X, Y, Z) 
		).
	</pre>
<li>	Exhaustiveness:
	<pre>
	:- all [X] promise_exhaustive 
		( 
			p(X, _) 
		; 
			q(X, _) 
		).  
	</pre>
<li>	Both together:
	<pre> 
	:- all [X] promise_exclusive_exhaustive  
		some [Y] ( 
			p(X, Y) 
		; 
			q(X, Y, Z)
		).
	</pre>
</ul>

All three declarations are restricted in the following ways:
<ol>
<li>	Any variable that occurs in more than one disjunct must be
	explicitly quantified.
<li>	Any variable occuring in only one disjunct is existentially quantified.
	This is similarly applicable when an underscore is used in place of a 
	variable.
</ol>

<h2> Development </h2>

This tracks the use of promise ex declarations through the compiler, and
may be useful as a quick summary of the current state of development. Items
marked with an asterisk (*) are not yet implemented. Places where data 
structures etc. have been defined are in italics.

<ol>
<li>	the declarations enter the parse tree
	<ul>
	<li>	<i>the operators are defined</i> (library/ops.m)
	<li>	<i>the structure for promise ex declarations in the parse tree 
		is defined</i> (prog_data.m)
	<li>	they are parsed and entered into the parse tree (prog_io.m)
	</ul>
<li>	they may be pretty printed (mercury_to_mercury.m, prog_out.m).
<li> 	they are error checked, and entered in to the HLDS as 
	dummy predicates
	<ul>
	<li>	error checking (make_hlds.m)
	<li>	entering of declarations into the HLDS as dummy predicates 
		(make_hlds.m)
	</ul>
<li>	go through typechecking as predicates; after typechecking they 
	are removed from processing as predicates and entered into the
	appropriate table in the HLDS
	<ul>
	<li>	post typechecking processing initiated for promise ex 
		declarations (purity.m)
	<li>	promise_exlusive and promise_exhaustive declarations are
		indexed by the predicate calls made in them in the exclusive 
		table (post_typecheck.m)
	<li>	<i>definition of exclusive table as part of HLDS, and
		operations on the table </i> 
		(hlds_module.m)
	<li>	(*) where a promise_exhaustive declaration is paired with a
		promise_exclusive declaration, they are merged into a
		promise_exclusive_exhaustive declaration; otherwise the
		promise_exhaustive declartion is entered in the exhaustive
		table of the HLDS (post_typecheck.m)
	<li>	(*) <i>definition of exhaustive table as part of HLDS, and
		operations on the table </i> 
		(hlds_module.m)
	</ul>
<li>	(*) exclusivity information is used during switch detection, and 
	where it leads to a full switch being made, applicable exhaustiveness 
	information is also used (switch_detection.m)
<li>	(*) exhaustiveness information is used during determinism analysis
	(det_analysis.m) or as an add-on to switch detection
	(switch_detection.m)
</ol>

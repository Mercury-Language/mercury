<h1>Promise Ex Declarations</h1>

This document is a description of promise ex declarations,
which are currently unfinished and as such are undocumented 
in the reference manual.
<p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

There are currently three promise ex declarations:
promise_exclusive, promise_exhaustive, and promise_exclusive_exhaustive.
They are used to denote determinism properties of a disjunction,
and denote either exclusivity exhaustiveness or both.
The examples of each, given below,
also show the different ways that existential quantification can be handled.

<ul>
<li>
Mutual exclusivity:
	<pre>
	:- all [X, Y] promise_exclusive
		some [Z] ( 
			p(X, Y, Z) 
		; 
			q(X, Y, Z) 
		).
	</pre>
<li>
Exhaustiveness:
	<pre>
	:- all [X] promise_exhaustive 
		( 
			p(X, _) 
		; 
			q(X, _) 
		).  
	</pre>
<li>
Both together:
	<pre> 
	:- all [X] promise_exclusive_exhaustive  
		some [Y] ( 
			p(X, Y) 
		; 
			q(X, Y, Z)
		).
	</pre>
</ul>

All three declarations are restricted in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>
Any variable that occurs in more than one disjunct
must be explicitly quantified.
<li>
Any variable occurring in only one disjunct is existentially quantified.
This is similarly applicable when an underscore is used in place of a variable.
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Development</h2>

This tracks the use of promise ex declarations through the compiler,
and may be useful as a quick summary of the current state of development.
Items marked with an asterisk (*) are not yet implemented.
Places where data structures etc. have been defined are in italics.

<ol>
<li>
The declarations enter the parse tree.
	<ul>
	<li>
    <i>The operators are defined</i> (library/ops.m).
	<li>
    <i>The structure for promise ex declarations in the parse tree
    is defined</i> (prog_data.m).
	<li>
    They are parsed and entered into the parse tree (parse_item.m).
	</ul>
<li>
They may be pretty printed (mercury_to_mercury.m, parse_tree_out.m).
<li>
They are error checked, and entered in to the HLDS as dummy predicates.
	<ul>
	<li>
    Error checking (make_hlds.m).
	<li>
    Entering of declarations into the HLDS as dummy predicates (make_hlds.m).
	</ul>
<li>
They go through typechecking as predicates.
After typechecking they are removed from processing as predicates
and entered into the appropriate table in the HLDS.
	<ul>
	<li>
    Post typechecking processing initiated for promise ex declarations
    (purity.m).
	<li>
    promise_exclusive and promise_exhaustive declarations
    are indexed by the predicate calls made in them
    in the exclusive table (post_typecheck.m).
	<li>
    <i>Definition of exclusive table as part of HLDS,
    and operations on the table</i> (hlds_module.m).
	<li>
    (*) Where a promise_exhaustive declaration
    is paired with a promise_exclusive declaration,
    they are merged into a promise_exclusive_exhaustive declaration;
    otherwise the promise_exhaustive declaration
    is entered in the exhaustive table of the HLDS (post_typecheck.m).
	<li>
    (*) <i>Definition of exhaustive table as part of HLDS, and
    operations on the table</i> (hlds_module.m).
	</ul>
<li>
(*) Exclusivity information is used during switch detection,
and where it leads to a full switch being made,
applicable exhaustiveness information is also used (switch_detection.m).
<li>
(*) Exhaustiveness information is used
during determinism analysis (det_analysis.m)
or as an add-on to switch detection (switch_detection.m).
</ol>

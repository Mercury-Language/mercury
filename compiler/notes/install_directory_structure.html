<title>The directory structure of installed Mercury libraries</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Both "mmake" and "mmc --make" have mechanisms
for installing a library to a target given directory.
The name of this target directory is often called the <em>install prefix</em>,
because the full pathname of all the installed files
will include this name as a prefix.

<p>
The install process will copy files with the following suffixes
to subdirectories of the install target directory.
(In the rest of this document,
we will refer to this list as the "library suffix list".)

<p>
<ul>
<li>
.int0
<li>
.int
<li>
.int2
<li>
.int3
<li>
.opt
<!--
<li>
.trans_opt
-->
<li>
.module_dep
<li>
.analysis
<li>
.mh     (for C grades)
<li>
.mih    (for C grades)
<li>
.init   (for C grades)
<li>
.LE     (for C grades, if --library-extension is .LE)
<li>
.SLE    (for C grades, if --shared-library-extension is .SLE)
<li>
.dll    (for C# grades)
<li>
.jar    (for Java grades)
</ul>

Note that common values of --library-extension include .a and .lib, while
common values of --shared-library-extension include .so, .dylib and .dll.

<p>
This document is intended to describe where (i.e. in which directories)
files with each of the above suffixes are, or should be, installed.
Specifically,
<p>
<ul>
<li>
where they <em>are</em> installed, by Mercury system versions
before 2024 September 15, and
<li>
where they <em>should be</em> installed,
in a simplified and rationalized system
that I (zs) think we should switch to.
</ul>

<p>
The rest of this document will identify these two "scenarios"
as LEGACY and PROPOSED respectively.

<p>
But before we can get to either of those,
we need some background on where these files are stored in workspaces.

<h1>The directory structure of Mercury workspaces</h1>

<p>
When the Mercury project started,
we always stored all compiler-generated files,
including all files with a suffix in the library suffix list,
in the directory that stored the Mercury source files they were derived from.
We refer to this directory as the "current directory",
since that the logical place to have your current directory (in the Unix sense)
when working on that code.

<p>
As the number of modules in e.g. the compiler directory grew,
the number of files in the current directory became a problem.
One problem was simply aesthetics:
the output of "ls" in the current directory contained lots of "clutter".
Another problem was more serious.
Some of the Unix systems we used then
had algorithms for filename lookups
whose complexity was linear in the number of entries in a directory.
This meant that the runtimes of tasks such as
generating the .int3 file for each module in the directory
was half-quadratic in the number of modules:
for each of N modules, the task of looking up that module's directory entry
had to scan at least N/2 other directory entries.

<h2>--use-subdirs</h2>

<p>
We implemented the --use-subdirs option to solve both problems.
(The second problem has since gone away, since pretty much
all modern versions of Unix, and other OSs,
have file lookup algorithms whose complexity is logarithmic
in the number of entries in the directory,
achieved by using data structures such as B-trees.
The first problem still remains.)
When --use-subdirs is specified,
the compiler still puts the kinds of files that are
explicitly intended to be looked at by the programmer,
such .err files and HLDS/MLDS dumps,
into the current directory,
but it puts all other kinds of files into another directory.

<p>
The compiler associates with each extension
an <em>extension directory name</em>.
the extension itself by deleting the initial dot and adding a final "s";
for example, for the .int3 extension,
the extension directory name is "int3s".
There are exceptions:
for the .class extension,
the extension directory name is "classes".
The final "s" is intended to denote the plural form of the extension.
This is because with --use-subdirs,
the compiler stores all files with the .class extension
in the directory named "Mercury/classes".

<p>
The general rule is:
if ExtDir is the extension directory name for the extension .Ext,
then for a module whose fully qualified module name is Fqmn,
the compiler will put its .Ext file into "Mercury/ExtDir/Fqmn.Ext".

<p>
This scheme works well if you do all your work in the same grade.
If you want to work on the same code in two or more different grades,
e.g. because you want to switch to a debug grade to hunt down a bug,
or if you want to switch back to the original grade
once you have found the bug,
you have a problem:
you have to nuke the Mercury directory and rebuild it from scratch
every time you want to switch grade.
This takes a nontrivial amount of time,
and therefore usually takes you any out of any "flow" state you had.
The --use-subdirs option does not help with this problem at all.

<h2>--use-grade-subdirs</h2>

<p>
We therefore added another option, --use-grade-subdirs, to solve this problem.

<p>
There are only three legal combinations of the settings of these options:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
--no-use-subdirs and --no-use-grade-subdirs
(globals.m calls this combination use_cur_dir.)
<li>
--use-subdirs and --no-use-grade-subdirs
(globals.m calls this combination use_cur_ngs_dir.)
<li>
--use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs
(globals.m calls this combination use_cur_ngs_gs_dir.)
</ul>

<p>
The fourth, illegal combination, --no-use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs,
is actually unreachable, because
--use-grade-subdirs implicitly implies --use-subdirs.

<p>
We classify extensions into two sets: grade-independent and grade-dependent.

<p>
For the grade-independent extensions,
the compiler puts their files

<p>
<ul>
<li>
into . (the current directory),
with --no-use-subdirs, or
<li>
into Mercury/ExtDir
with --use-subdirs
</ul>

<p>
LEGACY
For the grade-dependent extensions,
the compiler puts their files

<p>
<ul>
<li>
into . (the current directory),
with --no-use-subdirs, or
<li>
into Mercury/ExtDir
with --use-subdirs but --no-use-grade-subdirs, or
<li>
into Mercury/Grade/TargetArch/Mercury/ExtDir
with --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs,
</ul>

<p>
where Grade is a canonical representation of the grade
and TargetArch is a canonical representation of the target ISA
(instruction set architecture),
with both being in a form that is suitable as a directory name component.

<p>
Note that while some kinds of files with grade-dependent extensions,
such as .o, are dependent on the target ISA,
files with other grade-dependent extensions, such as .mih, are <em>NOT</em>,
so including the TargetArch component in their path names is overkill.

<p>
PROPOSED
For the grade-dependent extensions,
the compiler should put their files
<p>
<ul>
<li>
into . (the current directory),
with --no-use-subdirs, or
<li>
into MercurySystem/ExtDir
with --use-subdirs but --no-use-grade-subdirs, or
<li>
into MercurySystem/ExtDir/Grade
with --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs,
if files with the extension are not ISA specific
<li>
into MercurySystem/ExtDir/Grade/TargetArch
with --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs,
if files with the extension are ISA specific
</ul>

<p>
The point of using "MercurySystem" instead of "Mercury"
is to allow LEGACY and PROPOSED directory structures to coexist
for the transition period.
After that period is over, we can go back to using just "Mercury".

<h1>The principles of the PROPOSED directory structure</h1>

<p>
The principles governing the PROPOSED directory structure are the following.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Each installed file should occur in the install library structure just once.
(For backward compatibility,
we may want to make an exception for .mh and .mih files,
but the rest of this discussion assumes that we don't.)
<li>
The relative path from Prefix to the installed location
of the file Fqmn.Ext in an installed library
should be the same as the relative path from .
(the current directory in a workspace)
to the location of Fqmn.Ext in (or under) that same directory,
assuming a workspace with --use-grade-subdirs.
<li>
The first directory name component after MercurySystem
would dictate the structure of the subtree rooted at that directory.
The structure would be one of
    <ul>
    <li>
    containing only plain files
    (all of which are non-grade-specific);
    <li>
    containing only subdirectories that identify grades,
    each of which contains only plain files
    (all of which are grade-specific but not architecture-specific); or
    <li>
    containing only subdirectories that identify grades,
    each of which contains only subdirectories that identify architectures,
    each of which contains only plain files
    (all of which are both grade-specific and architecture-specific).
    </ul>
<li>
As a consequence of the above,
no directory in the installed library would contain
both directories and plain (non-directory) files.
<li>
As a consequence of the above,
the installed library would contain no symbolic links,
and especially no symbolic links that point to an ancestor directory :-(
</ul>

Based on the above, it should be possible to use a single new mmc option,
an accumulating option named something like --mercury-library-dir,
that can take as arguments the names of
<em>both</em> installed libraries
<em>and</em> other directories in the current workspace.
<p>
For any directory Dir named as such an argument,
when looking for Fqmn.Ext, mmc would search
    <ul>
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir/Grade
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir
    <li>
    Dir
    </ul>
in that order if .Ext files are grade-specific but not architecture-specific,
while it would search
    <ul>
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir
    <li>
    Dir
    </ul>
in that order if .Ext files are not grade-specific.
(mmc never searches for architecture-specific files.)

As a possible optimization, we could have a variant of this option,
named maybe --workspace-library-dir,
that is specialized for the use case where

<ul>
<li>
the named directory is another directory in the same workspace, and
<li>
the named directory and the current directory use the same settings
for --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs.
</ul>

This option variant would not do any search.
Instead of searching in e.g.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir/Grade
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir
    <li>
    Dir
    </ul>
it would simply look at the one entry on that list
that corresponds to the current settings
of the --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs options.
This would make mmc slightly faster.
However, the increased speed may be too small
to be worth both

<p>
<ul>
<li>
the risk to users of them specifying this option
even when the assumptions it needs are not satisfied, and
<li>
the cost to us of developing a mechanism that
integrates this with the base option.
(A command line that contains 
both --mercury-library-dir and --workspace-library-dir options
in some interleaved order
would require those directories to be searched in that order,
which means that the two options would need to maintain
a <em>common</em> list of directories,
even though different elements of that list
would be need to be treated differently.)
</ul>

<h1>System components that know the structure of install directories</h1>

The Mercury system components that
know about the structure of library install directories,
and which therefore must be updated if that structure ever changes,
are the following.
Most concern installs via mmake,
but the last one concerns installs via mmc --make.

<p>
<dl>
<dd>
scripts/Mmake.rules
<dt>
This file contains most of the rules
that install a library that has been built in a workspace
into a chosen target directory (also called the prefix directory above).
Specifically, these are all the <em>static</em> rules for library installs.
As of 2024 Sep 16, these rules are in the last section of the file.
<p>
<dd>
scripts/Mmake.vars.in
<dt>
The make entries in scripts/Mmake.rules
refer to (and depend on) the values of make variables
whose definitions are here.
As of 2024 Sep 16, these rules are towards the end of this file,
but not at the very end.
<p>
<dd>
compiler/generate_mmakefile_fragments.m
<dt>
While script/Mmake.rules contains
all the <em>static</em> rules for library installs,
this file contains the code to generate
the <em>dynamic</em> make rules for library installs.
Being dynamic allows these rules to be specialized
for the individual needs of a given library.
The relevant code is in the generate_dep_file_install_targets predicate.
<p>
<dd>
Mmakefile
<dt>
The Mmakefile in the top directory of each workspace
contains some of the code to install the Mercury system itself.
This requires installing several libraries (some in Mercury, some not)
as well as several executables.
As of 2024 Sep 16, these rules are in the second last section of the file.
<p>
<dd>
*/Mmakefile
<dt>
The Mmakefiles in the top-level subdirectories of each Mercury workspace
contain the rest of the code to install the Mercury system itself.
These files define the targets that the top level Mmakefile invokes.
<p>
XXX INSTALL Many of these files contain
almost-duplicate copies of the same entries.
It should be possible to factor out their commonalities.
<p>
<dd>
compiler/make.library_install.m
<dt>
This module contains all the code that installs libraries for mmc --make.
</dl>

<p>
XXX INSTALL There may be other files, such as bindist/bindist.Makefile.in.

<title>The directory structure of installed Mercury libraries</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Both "mmake" and "mmc --make" have mechanisms
for installing a library to a target given directory.
The name of this target directory is often called the <em>install prefix</em>,
because the full pathname of all the installed files
will include this name as a prefix.

<p>
The install process will copy files with the following suffixes
to subdirectories of the install target directory.
(In the rest of this document,
we will refer to this list as the "library suffix list".)

<p>
<ul>
<li>
.int0
<li>
.int
<li>
.int2
<li>
.int3
<li>
.opt
<!--
<li>
.trans_opt
-->
<li>
.module_dep
<li>
.analysis
<li>
.mh     (for C grades)
<li>
.mih    (for C grades)
<li>
.init   (for C grades)
<li>
.LE     (for C grades, if --library-extension is .LE)
<li>
.SLE    (for C grades, if --shared-library-extension is .SLE)
<li>
.dll    (for C# grades)
<li>
.jar    (for Java grades)
</ul>

<p>
Note that common values of --library-extension include .a and .lib, while
common values of --shared-library-extension include .so, .dylib and .dll.

<p>
This document is intended to describe where (i.e. in which directories)
files with each of the above suffixes are, or should be, installed.
Specifically,
<p>
<ul>
<li>
where they <em>are</em> installed, by Mercury system versions
before 2024 September 15, and
<li>
where they <em>should be</em> installed,
in a simplified and rationalized system
that I (zs) think we should switch to.
</ul>

<p>
The rest of this document will identify these two "scenarios"
as LEGACY and PROPOSED respectively.

<p>
But before we can get to either of those,
we need some background on where these files are stored in workspaces.

<h1>The directory structure of Mercury workspaces</h1>

<p>
When the Mercury project started,
we always stored all compiler-generated files,
including all files with a suffix in the library suffix list,
in the directory that stored the Mercury source files they were derived from.
We refer to this directory as the "current directory",
since that is the logical place to have as your current directory
(in the Unix sense) when working on that code.

<p>
As the number of modules in e.g. the compiler directory grew,
and as the number of files with different suffixes
associated with a given module also grew,
the number of files in the current directory became a problem.
One problem was simply aesthetics:
the output of "ls" in the current directory contained lots of "clutter".
Another problem was more serious.
Some of the Unix systems we used then
had algorithms for filename lookups
whose complexity was linear in the number of entries in a directory.
This meant that the runtimes of tasks such as
generating the .int3 file for each module in the directory
was half-quadratic in the number of modules:
for each of N modules, each of which had M associated files,
the task of looking up that module's directory entry
had to scan (on average) at least (N/2)*M other directory entries.

<h2>The --use-subdirs option</h2>

<p>
We implemented the --use-subdirs option to solve both problems.
(The second problem has since gone away, since pretty much
all modern versions of Unix, and other OSs,
have file lookup algorithms whose complexity is logarithmic
in the number of entries in the directory,
achieved by using data structures such as B-trees.
The first problem still remains.)
When --use-subdirs is specified,
the compiler still puts the kinds of files that are
explicitly intended to be looked at by the programmer,
such .err files and HLDS/MLDS dumps,
into the current directory,
but it puts all other kinds of files into another directory.

<p>
The compiler associates with each extension
an <em>extension directory name</em>.
It originally created this nam from the extension itself,
by deleting the initial dot and adding a final "s".
For example, for the .int3 extension,
the extension directory name is "int3s".
The final "s" is intended to denote the plural form of the extension.
This is because with --use-subdirs,
the compiler stores all files with e.g. the .int3 extension
in the directory named "Mercury/int3s".

<p>
We have since created some exceptions from the above rule.
For example, for the .class extension,
the extension directory name is "classes",
replacing the old, ugly ".classs" (sic).

<p>
The general rule is:
if ExtDir is the extension directory name for the extension .Ext,
then for a module whose fully qualified module name is Fqmn,
the compiler will put its .Ext file into "Mercury/ExtDir/Fqmn.Ext".

<p>
This scheme works well if you do all your work in the same grade.
If you want to work on the same code in two or more different grades,
e.g. because you want to switch to a debug grade to hunt down a bug,
or if you want to switch back to the original grade
once you have found the bug,
you have a problem:
you have to nuke the Mercury directory and rebuild it from scratch
every time you want to switch grade.
This takes a nontrivial amount of time,
and therefore usually takes you any out of any "flow" state you had.
The --use-subdirs option does not help with this problem at all.

<h2>The --use-grade-subdirs option</h2>

<p>
We therefore added another option, --use-grade-subdirs, to solve this problem.

<p>
There are only three legal combinations of the settings of these options:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
--no-use-subdirs and --no-use-grade-subdirs
(globals.m calls this combination use_cur_dir.)
<li>
--use-subdirs and --no-use-grade-subdirs
(globals.m calls this combination use_cur_ngs_dir.)
<li>
--use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs
(globals.m calls this combination use_cur_ngs_gs_dir.)
</ul>

<p>
The fourth, illegal combination, --no-use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs,
is actually unreachable, because
--use-grade-subdirs implicitly implies --use-subdirs.

<p>
We classify extensions into two sets:
<ul>
<li> the <em>non-grade-specific</em> extensions,
which are grade-independent, and
<li> the <em>grade-specific</em> extensions,
which are grade-dependent.
</ul>
We usually abbreviate these two classes
as <em>ngs</em> and <em>gs</em> respectively.

<p>
For the non-grade-specific extensions,
the compiler puts their files

<p>
<ul>
<li>
into . (the current directory),
with --no-use-subdirs, or
<li>
into Mercury/ExtDir
with --use-subdirs
</ul>

<p>
LEGACY
For the grade-specific extensions,
the compiler puts their files

<p>
<ul>
<li>
into . (the current directory),
with --no-use-subdirs, or
<li>
into Mercury/ExtDir
with --use-subdirs but --no-use-grade-subdirs, or
<li>
into Mercury/Grade/TargetArch/Mercury/ExtDir
with --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs,
</ul>

<p>
where Grade is a canonical representation of the grade
and TargetArch is a canonical representation of the target ISA
(instruction set architecture),
with both being in a form that is suitable as a directory name component.

<p>
Note that while some kinds of files with grade-specific extensions,
such as .o, are dependent on the target ISA,
files with other grade-specific extensions, such as .mih, are <em>NOT</em>,
so including the TargetArch component in their path names is overkill.

<p>
PROPOSED
For the grade-specific extensions,
the compiler should put their files
<p>
<ul>
<li>
into . (the current directory),
with --no-use-subdirs, or
<li>
into MercurySystem/ExtDir
with --use-subdirs but --no-use-grade-subdirs, or
<li>
into MercurySystem/ExtDir/Grade
with --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs,
if files with the extension are not ISA specific
<li>
into MercurySystem/ExtDir/Grade/TargetArch
with --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs,
if files with the extension are ISA specific
</ul>

<p>
The point of using "MercurySystem" instead of "Mercury"
is to allow LEGACY and PROPOSED directory structures to coexist
for the transition period.
After that period is over, we can go back to using just "Mercury".

<p>
Note that to prepare for the implementation of the PROPOSED install structure,
compiler/file_names.m makes a distinction
between non-architecture-specific and architecture-specific extensions.
It redefines the term grade-specific (<em>gs</em>)
to refer to <em>only</em> the former,
and introduces the term grade-and-architecture-specific (<em>gas</em>)
to refer to the latter.

<h1>Where files of various kinds are installed</h1>

<p>
The following shows, for each kind of file we install for a library,
where those files are installed
both in the LEGACY and in the PROPOSED install directory structures.

<h1>The PROPOSED directory structure of installed libraries</h1>

<p>
The following shows the overall structure of a library install directory
under the PROPOSED rules.
This table uses <em>main_module</em> to refer to the top module of the library,
and <em>moduleN</em> to refer to any module of the library,
whether it is the top module or not.
As above, LE and SLE stand for the values of the
--library-extension and --shared-library-extension options.

<h1>The principles of the PROPOSED directory structure</h1>

<p>
The principles governing the PROPOSED directory structure are the following.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Each installed file should occur in the install library structure just once.
(For backward compatibility,
we may want to make an exception for .mh and .mih files,
but the rest of this discussion assumes that we don't.)
<li>
The relative path from Prefix to the installed location
of the file Fqmn.Ext in an installed library
should be the same as the relative path from .
(the current directory in a workspace)
to the location of Fqmn.Ext in (or under) that same directory,
assuming a workspace with --use-grade-subdirs.
<li>
The first directory name component after MercurySystem
would dictate the structure of the subtree rooted at that directory.
The structure would be one of
    <ul>
    <li>
    containing only regular files
    (all of which are non-grade-specific);
    <li>
    containing only subdirectories that identify grades,
    each of which contains only regular files
    (all of which are grade-specific but not architecture-specific); or
    <li>
    containing only subdirectories that identify grades,
    each of which contains only subdirectories that identify architectures,
    each of which contains only regular files
    (all of which are both grade-specific and architecture-specific).
    </ul>
<li>
As a consequence of the above,
no directory in the installed library would contain
both directories and regular (non-directory) files.
<p>
XXX The above structure violates this for Prefix/MercurySystem/lib/Grade,
since it would contain both e.g. main_module.dll, a regular file,
and TargetArch, a directory.
<p>
XXX Should we replace Grade/TargetArch with e.g. Grade:TargetArch?
Or should we install .jar and .dll files to
Prefix/MercurySystem/jars/Grade/main_module.jar and
Prefix/MercurySystem/dlls/Grade/main_module.dll respectively?
The latter solution seems cleaner.
<li>
As a consequence of the above,
the installed library would contain no symbolic links,
and especially no symbolic links that point to an ancestor directory :-(
</ul>

Based on the above, it should be possible to use a single new mmc option,
an accumulating option named something like --mercury-library-dir,
that can take as arguments the names of
<em>both</em> installed libraries
<em>and</em> other directories in the current workspace.
<p>
For any directory Dir named in such an argument,
when looking for Fqmn.Ext, mmc would search
    <ul>
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir/Grade
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir
    <li>
    Dir
    </ul>
in that order if .Ext files are grade-specific but not architecture-specific,
while it would search
    <ul>
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir
    <li>
    Dir
    </ul>
in that order if .Ext files are not grade-specific.
(mmc never searches for architecture-specific files.)

As a possible optimization, we could have a variant of this option,
named maybe --workspace-library-dir,
that is specialized for the use case where

<ul>
<li>
the named directory is another directory in the same workspace, and
<li>
the named directory and the current directory use the same settings
for --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs.
</ul>

This option variant would not do any search.
Instead of searching in e.g.
    <ul>
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir/Grade
    <li>
    Dir/MercurySystem/ExtDir
    <li>
    Dir
    </ul>
it would simply look at the one entry on that list
that corresponds to the current settings
of the --use-subdirs and --use-grade-subdirs options.
This would make mmc slightly faster.
However, the increased speed may be too small
to be worth both

<p>
<ul>
<li>
the risk to users of them specifying this option
even when the assumptions it needs are not satisfied, and
<li>
the cost to us of developing a mechanism that
integrates this with the base option.
(A command line that contains 
both --mercury-library-dir and --workspace-library-dir options
in some interleaved order
would require those directories to be searched in that order,
which means that the two options would need to maintain
a <em>common</em> list of directories,
even though different elements of that list
would be need to be treated differently.)
<p>
A simple way to do this would be for
the --workspace-library-dir option to be a special option
that adds its argument to both
the list maintained by --mercury-library-dir
and to a second, separate list.
After getopt has done its job, we would convert the second list to a set.
Thereafter, we would search the --mercury-library-dir list almost as usual,
with the one difference being that
we would treat any entry on that list that is also in this set
as being an argument of --workspace-library-dir.
</ul>

<h1>System components that know the structure of install directories</h1>

The Mercury system components that
know about the structure of library install directories,
and which therefore must be updated if that structure ever changes,
are the following.
Most concern installs via mmake,
but the last one concerns installs via mmc --make.

<p>
<dl>
<dd>
scripts/Mmake.rules
<dt>
This file contains most of the rules
that install a library that has been built in a workspace
into a chosen target directory (also called the prefix directory above).
Specifically, these are all the <em>static</em> rules for library installs.
As of 2024 Sep 16, these rules are in the last section of the file.
<p>
<dd>
scripts/Mmake.vars.in
<dt>
The make entries in scripts/Mmake.rules
refer to (and depend on) the values of make variables
whose definitions are here.
As of 2024 Sep 16, these rules are towards the end of this file,
but not at the very end.
<p>
<dd>
compiler/generate_mmakefile_fragments.m
<dt>
While script/Mmake.rules contains
all the <em>static</em> rules for library installs,
this file contains the code to generate
the <em>dynamic</em> make rules for library installs.
Being dynamic allows these rules to be specialized
for the individual needs of a given library.
The relevant code is in the generate_dep_file_install_targets predicate.
<p>
<dd>
Mmakefile
<dt>
The Mmakefile in the top directory of each workspace
contains some of the code to install the Mercury system itself.
This requires installing several libraries (some in Mercury, some not)
as well as several executables.
As of 2024 Sep 16, these rules are in the second last section of the file.
<p>
<dd>
*/Mmakefile
<dt>
The Mmakefiles in the top-level subdirectories of each Mercury workspace
contain the rest of the code to install the Mercury system itself.
These files define the targets that the top level Mmakefile invokes.
<p>
XXX INSTALL Many of these files contain
almost-duplicate copies of the same entries.
It should be possible to factor out their commonalities.
<p>
<dd>
compiler/make.library_install.m
<dt>
This module contains all the code that installs libraries for mmc --make.
</dl>

<p>
XXX INSTALL There may be other files, such as bindist/bindist.Makefile.in.

</body>
</html>

<h1>The structure of the LEGACY mmake library install targets</h1>

The following description specifies,
for each mmake target, the following info:
<p>

<ul>
<li>
The name of the target, with "%" standing in for the name of the library.
This is the first item on the first line.
<li>
The location of the rule: either the standard Mmake.rules file,
or the .dep file generated for the library
(and therefore named after its main module).
This is the second item on the first line.
<li>
The job done by the actions of the rule.
This is within angle brackets on the second line.
<li>
The list of prerequisites of the target
that are also part of the install system.
The prereqs that require a file to be built
before we try to install it are not shown.
<li>
For the few rules whose actions explicitly call mmake recursively
we show the (install-related) targets of those recursive invocations.
</ul>

<p>
Note: some of the targets install mainly or exclusively grade-specific files,
but their names do not contain the word "grade".
The structure description below
extends those names with extra text containing that word,
with the extensions being distinguished by being inside square brackets.
<p>

<pre>
lib%.install                        (scripts/Mmake.rules)

    <installs all grade-specific files for all libgrades>
    no prereqs here; all prereqs are on the invoker, lib%.install

    invokes lib%.install_library[_grade_files] FOR EACH LIBGRADE

lib%.install_ints                   (main_module.dep)

<h1>The structure of the PROPOSED mmake library install targets</h1>

The PROPOSED structure of mmake rules
is much simpler than the LEGACY structure.
It would consist of only three mmake targets:

<p>
<pre>
lib%.install_all_files
lib%.install_ngs_pgs_files
lib%.install_gs_gas_files

<p>
The job of the first one would be
<ul>
<li>
to invoke lib%.install_ngs_pgs_files once, and
<li>
to invoke lib%.install_gs_gas_files for each install grade.
</ul>

<p>
The last two rules
divide the set of files to be installed into four categories.
<ul>
<li>
The non-grade-specific file category
consists of .int0, .int, .int2 and .int3 files.
<li>
The pseudo-grade-specific file category consists of .mh files.
These files are not grade-specific,
but they can be installed <em>only</em>
when the library is built in a grade that targets C.
So their install <em>time</em> is grade-specific,
though their install <em>target directory</em> is not.
<li>
The grade-specific file category consists of
.mih, .opt, .trans_opt, .module_dep, .analysis,
.init, .jar and .dll files.
<li>
The grade-and-architecture-specific file category
consists of .LE and .SLE files,
whose suffixes are given by the values of the
--library-extension and --shared-library-extension options.
</ul>

<p>
Since we support the use of mmake only in grades that target C,
the library will initially be built in such a grade,
which means that we can install pgs files as well as ngs files in that state.

<p>
The code of the first rule could include code
that tests the target language of each library grade,
and invokes mmc --make instead of a recursive mmake
if that language is Java or C#.
This would enable users to include Java and/or C# grades
in the list of grades in which to install a library.
This is a capability that, as far as I (zs) know, does not currently exist.

<p>
The proposed three mmake targets,
lib%.install_all_files, lib%.install_ngs_pgs_files
and lib%.install_gs_gas_files,
would all be in the library's main module's .dep file.
This would have two main advantages.
The first concerns only Mercury developers;
the second concerns mostly Mercury users.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
With the LEGACY structure,
any update that affects both a target in Mmake.rules
and in the compiler-generated main_module.dep file
has to contend with the fact that
updating the Mmake.rules file and the compiler
does <em>not</em> automatically update any previously-generated .dep file,
and that an mmake invocation that uses both an updated Mmake.rules file
and a non-updated .dep file will probably generate
strange and hard-to-reproduce errors.
With the PROPOSED rules for all targets being in the same file,
such problems cannot happen.
<li>
The targets being in the same file,
and there being only three of them,
their actions should also be easier to read and to understand,
for any Mercury programmer who wants to understand them.
This should be especially so because the code of the rules
would be specialized for the actual setup of the library,
in that e.g. there would be no targets or actions for installing .opt files
if --intermodule-optimization is not specified for the library.
</ul>

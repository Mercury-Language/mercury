<h1>Interface files</h1>

<h2>A warning</h2>

<p>
Our system of interface files is quite complex,
Some of the complexity is justified, or at least was justified at the time.
Other aspects are almost certainly accidents.
The compiler's old representation of parse trees as raw lists of items,
with any structure and constraints being implicit rather than explicit,
was quite error prone;
since the structure and constraints were not expressed in types,
violations did not result in type errors,
and thus could accumulate undetected.

<p>
I (zs) don't believe any design document for this system
ever existed outside of Fergus's head.
This document is my (zs's) attempt to reconstruct that design document.
In the rest of this file, I will try to be careful to explicitly distinguish
between what I <em>know</em> to be true,
and what I only <em>believe</em> to be true,
either because I remember it, or because I deduce it from the code.
Note also that I may be mistaken.

<h2>Automatic generation of interface files</h2>

<p>
The principle of information hiding dictates that
only <em>some</em> of the contents of a module
should be visible outside the module.
The part that is visible outside the module
is usually called <em>the interface</em>,
while the part that is not visible outside the module
is usually called <em>the implementation</em>.

<p>
When compiling a module A that imports functionality from module B,
the compiler usually wants to read a file
containing <em>only</em> the interface of module B.
In some languages such as Ada, C and C++,
programmers themselves write this file.
Having to maintain two files for one module can be a bit of a hassle,
so in other languages, such as Haskell,
programmers only ever edit one file for each module (its source file).
Within that file, they indicate which parts are public and which are not,
and the compiler uses this information to generate
each module's interface file automatically.

<h2>Introduction to interface files</h2>

<p>
In Mercury, the source code of each module is in a single file,
whose suffix is .m,
and the generation of interface files is solely the job of the compiler.
However, unlike most other similar programming languages,
the compiler generates three or four different interface files for each source file,
and it generates these in two or three steps.
<p>
The steps are as follows.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
The compiler option --make-short-interface
calls for the creation of the .int3 files
of the modules named as arguments.
<li>
The compiler option --make-private-interface
calls for the creation of the .int0 files
of the modules named as arguments.
<li>
The compiler option --make-interface
calls for the creation of the .int and .int2 files
of the modules named as arguments.
</ul>

<p>
The different kinds of interface files are as follows.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
The .int3 files are generated first,
using only the module's .m file as input.

<p>
They were originally intended to record just the names
of the types, insts and modes are defined in the module,
to allow references to these names
to be disambiguated (i.e. to be fully module qualified)
when creating the other kinds of interface files for other modules.

<p>
However, we were forced to include information of the form
"type A is defined to be equivalent to type B" in .int3 files,
because on 32 bit architectures, if type B is "float",
then modules that work with values of type A
need to know to reserve two words for them, not one.

<li>
The .int0 files are generated next,
but only for modules that include submodules.
The submodules of a module A have access to parts of A
that other, third-part modules do not.

<p>
I believe the intention was that A.int0 play the same role
for these exported-only-to-submodules parts of A
as some other module's .int3 file plays
for its exported-to-everyone parts.
I believe the A.int0 file should be read only when processing A's submodules:
either creating their .int/.int2 files, or generating target code for them.

<li>
The .int and .int2 files are the interface files that are generated last,
using as input not only the module's .m file,
but also the .int3 files of the other modules
(certainly those imported by this module, but possibly others as well),
and the .int0 files of any ancestor modules.

<p>
The .int file plays the traditional role of the interface file;
it is an automatically generated analogue
of a C header file or Ada package specification.
As such, it contains everything in the module's interface section(s),
plus some other information from the implementation section
that the compiler has found it needed over the years.

<p>
The compiler generates .int2 files from .int files
by simply filtering out some items.
I cannot find the place in the logs where .int2 files were introduced
(it seems to have been lost in the CVS to git transition),
but I think the point of .int2 files was that
a module's .int2 file would change less often than its .int file.
Therefore if another module depended
on its .int2 file instead of on its .int file,
it would have to be recompiled less often.
However, that is only a guess.

<p>
Something to keep in mind:
while the --make-short-interface compiler option
calls for the creation of .int3 files,
several predicate and variable names inside the compiler
use the term "short interface files" to refer to .int2 files.
While sort-of justifiable, in that .int2 files
are in fact shorter versions of .int files,
it can nevertheless be extremely confusing.
</ul>

<h2>The contents of .int3 files</h2>

<p>
The contents of the .int3 file of a module are derived solely from
the contents of the interface sections of that module.
Each item in these sections
<ul>
<li>
may be included in the .int3 file unchanged;
<li>
may be included in the .int3 file after some changes; or
<li>
it may be left out of the .int3 file.
</ul>

<p>
The rules for choosing between these three outcomes
of course depend on the item's type.

<p>
<ul>

<li>
Type definitions are always included in the .int3 file in some form,
but the form depends on what kind of type is being defined.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Abstract type definitions (i.e. type declarations) are left unchanged.
<li>
Definitions of discriminated union (du) types
are included in an abstract form,
but this abstract form records whether the type being defined
is a dummy type, a notag type, a subword-sized type that fits in N bits,
or general abstract type
(which means a type that fits none of those categories).
<li>
Solver type definitions are made abstract as well.
<li>
Definitions that define a type to be equivalent to another type
are also replaced by (general) abstract type definitions.
<em>XXX</em> This may be the wrong thing to do for types
that are equivalent to types that are dummies, notags, or subword-sized.
<li>
Definitions of foreign types are included with only one minor change:
if the type has user-specified unification and/or comparison predicates,
the part of the type definition naming those predicates is deleted.
Since all unifications and comparisons of values of the type
will call the unify and compare predicates of the type,
which will be generated inside this module,
only this module needs to know the noncanonical nature of this type.
</ul>
<p>
The overall effect of these rules is that for each type definition,
we convey two pieces of information to the reader of the .int3 file.

<p>
The first piece of information is just the name of the type,
which the readers need for disambiguation.
Every name in a .int file must be fully module qualified,
so if the interface section of a module refers to type t1,
the code that creates the module's .int file needs to know
which of the imported modules defines a type named t1.
It gets this information from the .int3 files
of the modules listed in import_module (and use_module) declarations.

<p>
The second piece of information is
whether the representation of the given type differs from the standard,
and if so, how.
<em>XXX</em> I intend to put this info into
type representation items that are separate from the type definition items.

<p>
<li>
Inst and mode definitions are always included in the .int3 file unchanged.
<em>XXX</em> I know that the names of defined insts and modes must be put
into the .int3 file for the same reason as the names of defined types,
but I don't understand the reason for putting the entire definition
into the .int3 file.

<p>
<li>
Class definitions are always included in the .int3 file in abstract form.
Again, the reason is to allow references to class names
to be fully module qualified.

<p>
<li>
Instance definitions are always included in the .int3 file in abstract form.
Since instance definitions do not define any new names,
this cannot be for purposes of module qualification.
I think it is probably to help detect overlapping instances,
but I am not sure.

<p>
<li>
The type and mode declarations of predicates and functions
are never included in .int3 files.

<p>
<li>
Clauses should never occur in interface sections,
Not only are they never included in .int3 files,
we generate a warning for them.
<em>XXX</em> This warning can be annoying,
since it is sent to the terminal, not to the module's .err file.
I think it would be better to ignore such errors when generating .int3 files,
and report them later, when generating code.

<p>
<li>
Pragmas are never included in .int3 files.
For the ones that may not occur in interface sections,
we generate a warning, as we do for clauses.
<em>XXX</em> These warnings have the same problems as warnings for clauses.

<p>
<li>
Foreign_import_module items are never includes in .int3 files.

<p>
<li>
Promises are never included in .int3 files.
Neither are definitions of mutables, or initialize and finalize declarations.

<p>
<li>
Declarations of submodules are always included in the .int3 file unchanged.

<p>
<li>
If the interface contains no inst definitions, mode definitions,
typeclass definitions or instance definitions,
then none of the interface's module import and use declarations
will be included in the .int3 file.
If it does, then all of the interface's module import and use declarations
will be included in the .int3 file.

<p>
When generating .int3 files, the compiler has no way to know whether
the names of the type constructors
in the heads of the (abstract forms of) typeclass and instance definitions
are fully qualified or not.
Copying all the import_module declarations from the interface to the .int3 file
allows readers of the .int3 file to fully module qualify them.

<p>
I (zs) don't think we should include
the right hand sides of inst and mode definitions in .int3 files,
but as long as we do, we need to copy
all the import_module declarations from the interface to the .int3 file
to help readers module qualify them.

<p>
<em>XXX</em> In neither case does this justify copying use_module declarations,
since the source code must fully module qualify
any reference to any type in such a module,
leaving nothing to be done by the readers of the .int3 file.

<h1>Interface files</h1>

<h2>A warning</h2>

<p>
Our system of interface files is quite complex.
Some of the complexity is justified, or at least was justified at the time.
Other aspects are almost certainly accidents.
The compiler's old representation of parse trees as raw lists of items,
with any structure and constraints being implicit rather than explicit,
was quite error prone;
since the structure and constraints were not expressed in types,
violations did not result in type errors,
and thus could accumulate undetected.
<p>
I (zs) don't believe any design document for this system
ever existed outside of Fergus's head.
This document is my (zs's) attempt to reconstruct that design document.
In the rest of this file, I will try to be careful to explicitly distinguish
between what I <em>know</em> to be true,
and what I only <em>believe</em> to be true,
either because I remember it, or because I deduce it from the code.
Note also that I may be mistaken.

<h2>Automatic generation of interface files</h2>

<p>
The principle of information hiding dictates that
only <em>some</em> of the contents of a module
should be visible outside the module.
The part that is visible outside the module
is usually called <em>the interface</em>,
while the part that is not visible outside the module
is usually called <em>the implementation</em>.
<p>
When compiling a module A that imports functionality from module B,
the compiler usually wants to read a file
containing <em>only</em> the interface of module B.
In some languages such as Ada, C and C++,
programmers themselves write this file.
Having to maintain two files for one module can be a bit of a hassle,
so in other languages, such as Haskell,
programmers only ever edit one file for each module (its source file).
Within that file, they indicate which parts are public and which are not,
and the compiler uses this information to generate
each module's interface file automatically.

<h2>Introduction to interface files</h2>

<p>
In Mercury, the source code of each module is in a single file,
whose suffix is .m,
and the generation of interface files is solely the job of the compiler.
However, unlike most other similar programming languages,
the compiler generates three or four different interface files
for each source file,
and it generates these in two or three steps.
<p>
The steps are as follows.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
The compiler option --make-short-interface
calls for the creation of the .int3 files
of the modules named as arguments.
<li>
The compiler option --make-private-interface
calls for the creation of the .int0 files
of the modules named as arguments.
<li>
The compiler option --make-interface
calls for the creation of the .int and .int2 files
of the modules named as arguments.
</ul>

<p>
The different kinds of interface files are as follows.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
The .int3 files are generated first,
using only the module's .m file as input.
<p>
They were originally intended to record just the names
of the types, insts and modes are defined in the module,
to allow references to these names
to be disambiguated (i.e. to be fully module qualified)
when creating the other kinds of interface files for other modules.
<p>
However, we were forced to include information of the form
"type A is defined to be equivalent to type B" in .int3 files,
because on 32 bit architectures, if type B is "float",
then modules that work with values of type A
need to know to reserve two words for them, not one.
<p>
<li>
The .int0 files are generated next,
but only for modules that include submodules.
The submodules of a module A have access to parts of A
that other, third-party modules do not.
<p>
I believe the intention was that A.int0 play the same role
for these exported-only-to-submodules parts of A
as some other module's .int3 file plays
for its exported-to-everyone parts.
I believe the A.int0 file should be read only when processing A's submodules:
either creating their .int/.int2 files, or generating target code for them.
<p>
<li>
The .int and .int2 files are the interface files that are generated last,
using as input not only the module's .m file,
but also the .int3 files of other modules
(certainly those imported by this module, but possibly others as well),
and the .int0 files of any ancestor modules.
<p>
The .int file plays the traditional role of the interface file;
it is an automatically generated analogue
of a C header file or Ada package specification.
As such, it contains everything in the module's interface section(s),
plus some other information from the implementation section
that the compiler has found it needed over the years.
<p>
The compiler generates .int2 files from .int files
by filtering out some items.
The original filtering algorithm was the same as
the one we applied to the original module to generate .int3 files.
I believe the intention was to make each .int2 file
a fully module qualified version of the corresponding .int3 file.
However, since the differences between the two starting points
(the unqualified whole module for .int3 files
and its fully module qualified .int file)
are not restricted to differences in qualification,
and the two filtering algorithms have also diverged over time,
so the differences between a module's .int2 and .int3 files
are <em>not</em> be restricted to just qualification.
<p>
Something to keep in mind:
while the --make-short-interface compiler option
calls for the creation of .int3 files,
several predicate and variable names inside the compiler
use the term "short interface files" to refer to .int2 files.
While sort-of justifiable, in that
.int2 files are in fact shorter versions of .int files,
it can nevertheless be extremely confusing.
</ul>

<h2>The contents of .int3 files</h2>

<p>
The contents of the .int3 file of a module are derived solely from
the contents of the interface sections of that module.
Each item in these sections

<ul>
<li>
may be included in the .int3 file unchanged;
<li>
may be included in the .int3 file after some changes; or
<li>
it may be left out of the .int3 file.
</ul>

<p>
If the item is included in the .int3 file, whether changed or unchanged,
it stays in the interface section,
so .int3 files contain no implementation section.
<p>
After we decide what items to include in the .int3 file,
its contents are module qualified to the maximum extent possible.
However, this cannot guarantee <em>full</em> module qualification,
for reasons explained below.
<p>
The rules for choosing between the above three outcomes
of course depend on the item's type.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Type definitions are always included in the .int3 file in some form,
but the form depends on what kind of type is being defined.
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Abstract type definitions (i.e. type declarations) are left unchanged.
    <li>
    Definitions of discriminated union (du) types
    are included in an abstract form,
    but this abstract form records whether the type being defined
    is a dummy type, a notag type, a subword-sized type that fits in N bits,
    or general abstract type
    (which means a type that fits none of those categories).
    <li>
    Solver type definitions are made abstract as well.
    <li>
    Definitions that define a type to be equivalent to another type
    are also replaced by (general) abstract type definitions.
    <em>XXX</em> This may be the wrong thing to do for types
    that are equivalent to types that are dummies, notags, or subword-sized.
    <li>
    Definitions of foreign types are included with only one minor change:
    if the type has user-specified unification and/or comparison predicates,
    the part of the type definition naming those predicates is deleted.
    Since all unifications and comparisons of values of the type
    will call the unify and compare predicates of the type,
    which will be generated inside this module,
    only this module needs to know the noncanonical nature of this type.
    </ul>
<p>
The overall effect of these rules is that for each type definition,
we convey two pieces of information to the reader of the .int3 file.
<p>
The first piece of information is just the name of the type,
which the readers need for disambiguation.
Every name in a .int file must be fully module qualified,
so if the interface section of a module refers to type t1,
the code that creates the module's .int file needs to know
which of the imported modules defines a type named t1.
It gets this information from the .int3 files
of the modules listed in import_module declarations.
<p>
The second piece of information is
whether the representation of the given type differs from the standard,
and if so, how.
<em>XXX</em> The compiler can now put this info into type representation items
that are separate from the type definition items.
For now, it actually does so only if the value of the --experiment option
is set to a special value.
<p>
<li>
Inst and mode definitions are always included in the .int3 file
in an abstract form that contains no information except their name and arity.
The reason is to allow references to inst and mode names
to be fully module qualified.
<p>
<li>
Class definitions are also included in the .int3 file
in an abstract form that contains no information except their name and arity.
Again, the reason is to allow references to class names
to be fully module qualified.
<p>
<li>
Instance definitions are always included in the .int3 file in abstract form.
Since instance definitions do not define any new names,
this cannot be for purposes of module qualification.
I think it is probably to help detect overlapping instances,
but I am not sure.
<p>
<li>
The type and mode declarations of predicates and functions
are never included in .int3 files.
<p>
<li>
Clauses should never occur in interface sections,
Not only are they never included in .int3 files,
we generate a warning for them.
<em>XXX</em> This warning can be annoying,
since it is sent to the terminal, not to the module's .err file.
I think it would be better to ignore such errors when generating .int3 files,
and report them later, when generating code.
<p>
<li>
Pragmas are never included in .int3 files.
For the ones that may not occur in interface sections,
we generate a warning, as we do for clauses.
<em>XXX</em> These warnings have the same problems as warnings for clauses.
<p>
<li>
Foreign_import_module items are never included in .int3 files.
<p>
<li>
Promises are never included in .int3 files.
<p>
<li>
Mutables are never included in .int3 files.
<p>
<li>
Initialise and finalize declarations are never included in .int3 files.
<p>
<li>
Declarations of submodules are always included in the .int3 file unchanged.
<p>
<li>
We include in the .int3 file
the module's import_module (but not use_module) declarations
only if the .int3 file contains at least one item
that contains a name (type name, inst name, mode name etc)
that may be defined in those other modules.
In that case, the module qualification of that name
will require knowing which other module defines that name.
<p>
At the moment, such possibly unqualified names may appear in
<p>
<ul>
<li>
the member types in the heads of abstract instance definitions
(all instance definitions in .int3 files are abstract).
</ul>
<p>
If the interface contains any of these kinds of items,
then <em>none</em> of the interface's import_module declarations
will be included in the .int3 file.
If it does, then <em>all</em> of the interface's
import_module declarations will be included in the .int3 file.
</ul>

<p>
<em>XXX</em>
While type definition items will never contain references
to type constructor names that may require qualification,
type <em>representation</em> items for equivalence types may.
<p>
<em>XXX</em>
If e.g. the constructor t1/0 appears in an abstract instance definition,
and the module defines a type constructor t1/0,
this arguably should <em>not</em> require us
to include all the imports in the .int3 file.
The reason has two parts.
Either the t1/0 is defined in one or more of the imported modules, or it isn't.
If it is not defined in any of them,
then causing the readers of this module's .int3 file
to read those other modules' .int3 files
will just compute the same result, only slower.
On the other hand, if some of those modules do define t1/0,
then this type constructor is multiply defined, so its appearance
in the instance definition is ambiguous.
This fact will be reported in an error message when
this module is compiled to target code.
Reporting it during some other compiler invocation
that happens to read this module's .int3 file
may be more of a distraction than a help.
<p>
<em>XXX</em>
We should investigate replacing the copied import_module declaration list
with a single item that says
"these type, inst, etc names in this .int3 file
may be defined in these other modules".
This should have two benefits.
One, it would allow us to stop the transitive grabbing of .int3 files
as soon as we have read the .int3 files
that define all the type, inst etc names that are still outstanding.
Two, it should allow us to start using the transitively grabbed files
<em>only</em> for their intended purpose,
which should stop "leaks" of declarations/definitions
from these transitively-included-only-for-module-qualification modules
to the HLDS of the module being compiled.
Right now, it is possible, though rare,
to delete an import of module b from module a,
and discover that this results in an error:
a type being undefined, when that type is defined in module c.
This happens only because the import of b
dragged with it the definitions inside c as well,
so that the import of c was required by the language definition
but <em>not</em> by the compiler.

<h2>The contents of .int0 files</h2>

<p>
The contents of the .int0 file of a module are derived from the contents of
both the interface sections and the implementation sections of that module,
<em>after</em> they are fully module qualified.
This requires reading in, via grab_unqual_imported_modules_make_int,
<ul>
<li>
the .int0 files of this module's ancestor modules;
<li>
the .int3 files of the modules used or imported by this module;
<li>
the .int3 files of the modules imported by the .int0 or .int3 files
we have read in under the first, second or <em>third</em> point,
until we get to a fixpoint.
</ul>

<p>
Items are never moved between sections:
items in the interface section of the module
are put into the interface section of the .int0 file,
while items in the implementation section of the module
are put into the implementation section of the .int0 file.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Type definitions are always included in the .int0 file unchanged.
<em>XXX</em> Julien says this may be the wrong thing to do for solver types,
and that the failure of the submodules/ts test case
with intermodule optimization may be caused by this.
<p>
<li>
Inst and mode definitions are always included in the .int0 file unchanged.
<p>
<li>
Class definitions are always included in the .int0 file unchanged.
<p>
<li>
Instance definitions are always included in the .int3 file in abstract form.
<p>
<li>
The type and mode declarations of predicates and functions
are always included in .int0 files unchanged.
<p>
<li>
Clauses are never included in .int0 files.
<p>
<li>
Pragmas that may appear in interface sections
are always included in .int0 files unchanged
(regardless of which section they <em>actually</em> appear in).
Pragmas that may not appear in interface sections
are never included in .int0 files.
<p>
<li>
Foreign_import_module items are always included in .int0 files.
<p>
<li>
Promises are always included in .int0 files unchanged.
<p>
<li>
Mutables are never included in .int0 files.
(This is because every module that sees a mutable declaration
would attempt to reserve its own memory for the mutable;
having more than one location for a single mutable would obviously not work.)
However, we do put automatically generated predmode declarations
for all of the mutable's get and set predicates into .int0 files.
<p>
<li>
Initialize and finalize declarations are never included in .int0 files.
<p>
<li>
Declarations of submodules are always included in the .int0 file unchanged.
<p>
<li>
Import_module and use_module declarations
are always included in the .int0 file unchanged.
</ul>

<h2>The contents of .int files</h2>

<p>
The contents of the .int file of a module are derived from the contents of
both the interface sections and the implementation sections of that module,
<em>after</em> they are fully module qualified.
This requires reading in, via grab_unqual_imported_modules_make_int,

<ul>
<li>
the .int0 files of this module's ancestor modules;
<li>
the .int3 files of the modules used or imported by this module;
<li>
the .int3 files of the modules imported by the .int0 or .int3 files
we have read in under the first, second or <em>third</em> point,
until we get to a fixpoint.
</ul>

<p>
Items are never moved between sections:
items in the interface section of the module
are put into the interface section of the .int file,
while items in the implementation section of the module
are put into the implementation section of the .int file.

<p>

<!--
<em>XXX</em>
pre vs post qual; interface vs implementation
<p>
<em>XXX</em>
pre-qual in the interface:
keep instance definitions after deleting the instance's methods;
keep everything else unchanged.
<p>
<em>XXX</em>
pre-qual in the implementation:
keep type_defns after calling make_canon_make_du_and_solver_types_abstract;
keep class defns after deleting the class's methods;

keep foreign_import_modules;
delete everything else,
<p>
-->

<ul>
<li>
Type definitions in the interface
are always included in the .int file unchanged.
<p>
Type definitions in the implementation section
are transformed in two stages: before and after qualification.
<p>
In the first, pre-qualification stage,
we transform such all type definitions as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>
    Abstract type definitions (i.e. type declarations) are left unchanged.
    <li>
    Definitions of discriminated union (du) types
    are included with only one minor change:
    if the type has user-specified unification and/or comparison predicates,
    the part of the type definition naming those predicates is deleted.
    The part of the definition
    that specifies the function symbols and their argument types is left in.
    <em>XXX</em>
    The reason given for keeping the function symbol info is that
    they may be needed for processing insts
    that may name those function symbols,
    but the function symbols of most nonexported types
    are not named by any inst in scope.
    <li>
    Definitions of foreign types are also included
    with the only change being the deletion of the names
    of any user-specified unification and/or comparison predicates.
    <li>
    Definitions that define a type to be equivalent to another type
    are included as as, <em>without</em> being made abstract.
    <em>XXX</em>
    To handle 64 bit floats on 32 bit platforms correctly,
    the compiler needs to be able to fully expand
    all chains of type equivalences.
    However, the right way to transmit the fact of the equivalence
    is through type_repn items (which can be used only for this purpose),
    and not type_defn items (which can be used for semantic checks as well,
    possibly violating encapsulation).
    <li>
    Solver type definitions are made fully abstract.
    There is an <em>XXX</em> by rafe on the relevant code,
    saying this may be the wrong thing to do.
    </ul>
<p>
<em>XXX</em> This is done by make_canon_make_du_and_solver_types_abstract,
which is relevant for the .int2 section below.
<p>
In the second, post-qualification stage,
we keep only a subset of the type definitions in the implementation section,
and even the ones we keep, we transform further.
<em>XXX</em> Actually, we transform them further
<em>only</em> if they have only one definition in the implementation section.
If they have two or more, we leave them alone.
This is almost certainly a bug.
<p>
We keep a type definition in the implementation section
if the type constructor being defined
satisfies any of the following conditions:
    <ul>
    <li>
    The type constructor has a definition is a du type that is
    either a direct dummy type or an abstract enum type.
    We preserve these because they provide information
    for decisions about type representation.
    The <em>form</em> in which we preserve them is as abstract types
    that nevertheless say that the type is a direct dummy or an enum type.
    <em>XXX</em> This info should be in type_repn items.
    <li>
    The type constructor has a definition is a foreign type.
    We preserve such type definitions unchanged.
    <em>XXX</em> The ostensible reason is that
    this is also for decisions about type representation,
    but I do not believe it.
    <li>
    The type constructor has a definition that is an equivalence type.
    We preserve such type definitions unchanged,
    because equivalence chains have to be expanded fully
    when deciding type representations.
    <em>XXX</em> The info about type equivalences should be in type_repn items.
    <li>
    The type constructor appears in the expansion
    of the right hand side of a type equivalence.
    We preserve the definitions of such types
    because the algorithm deciding type representations
    needs to know about them.
    because equivalence chains have to be expanded fully
    Such a type can be of any kind: discriminated union, foreign, abstract,
    another equivalence type, or even a solver type,
    though solver types will have been made abstract before qualification.
    The <em>form</em> in which the type definition will be preserved
    is given by the relevant bullet point above.
    <li>
    The type constructor appears in the argument type of a function symbol
    in the discriminated union definition of another type constructor
    that occurs in the expansion of the right hand side of a type equivalence.
    Again, the reason is that the
    algorithm deciding type representations needs to know about them,
    And again, the <em>form</em> in which the type definition will be preserved
    is given by the relevant bullet point above.
    <em>XXX</em>
    only SOME expansions
    <li>
    <em>TODO check if there are any more categories</em>
    </ul>
<p>
Note that a type constructor may have more than one definition
either within the rules of Mercury
(e.g. an abstract and a non-abstract definition,
or a Mercury definition and some foreign definitions),
or violating the rules of Mercury,
as in the case of buggy code.
<p>
<li>
Inst and mode definitions in the interface
are always included in the .int file unchanged.
Inst and mode definitions in the implementation
are never included in the .int file unchanged.
<em>XXX</em>
We don't touch the type constructors
in ":- inst ... for typector" declarations.
Maybe we should treat them as type constructors
in superclasses in typeclass declarations:
i.e. we should consider them ground for importing any modules they mention.
<p>
<li>
Class definitions in the interface
are always included in the .int file unchanged.
Class definitions in the implementation
are always included in the .int file with the methods deleted.
<em>XXX Why?</em>
<p>
<li>
Instance definitions in the interface
are always included in the .int file with the methods deleted.
Instance definitions in the implementation
are never included in the .int file.
<p>
<li>
The type and mode declarations of predicates and functions in the interface
are always included in the .int file unchanged.
The type and mode declarations of predicates and functions
in the implementation
are never included in the .int file.
<p>
<li>
Clauses are never included in .int files.
<p>
<li>
Pragmas in the interface section
are always included in .int files unchanged,
provided that they <em>may</em> appear in interface sections.
The only pragmas in the implementation section
that are included in the .int file are foreign_enum pragmas
for type constructors that are defined in the interface section
in a non-abstract form.
<p>
<li>
Promises in the interface section
are included in .int files if and only if they promise
exclusivity, exhaustiveness, or both.
<em>XXX Why the limitation?</em>
Promises in the implementation section
are never included in .int files.
<p>
<li>
Mutables are never included in .int files.
<p>
<li>
Initialize and finalize declarations are never included in .int files.
<p>
<li>
Declarations of submodules are always included in the .int file unchanged.
<p>
<li>
Explicit foreign_import_module items in the source file
are included in the .int file,
in the same section as their original occurrence.
These foreign_import_module items may import
either the current module or any other module, in any target language.
<p>
The compiler also puts foreign_import_module items into .int files
automatically, without explicit action by the programmer.
These implicit foreign_import_module items always import the current module.
<p>
We put such an implicit self-import
into the interface of the .int file for a given target language
if the .int file interface also contains either
a foreign type definition or a foreign enum pragma for that language.
Likewise, we put such an implicit self-import
into the implementation of the .int file for a given target language
if the .int file interprocess also contains either
a foreign type definition or a foreign enum pragma for that language.
<p>
There is one exception from the above.
If the interface section of the .int file contains
a foreign_import_module for a given module in a given target language,
then the compiler won't include
a copy of the same foreign_import_module item in the implementation section,
either explicitly or implicitly.
<p>
<li>
We put a use_module declaration
into the interface section of the .int file
for all of the modules that have an import_module and/or use_module declaration
in the module's interface section.
<p>
We put a use_module declaration
into the implementation section of the .int file
for all of the modules that have an import_module and/or use_module declaration
in the module's implementation section, provided
<ul>
<li>
the module defines an entity
that occurs in a superclass constraint of a typeclass declaration
in the implementation section of the .int file; or
<li>
the module defines an entity
that occurs on the right hand side of a type definition
in the implementation section of the .int file.
</ul>
<p>
The reason why we need to use_module declarations for these modules
is that the compiler creates entries
for e.g. the types we are imported from them
only when it sees them defined, not when it sees them used.
<em>XXX</em>
XXX We should consider fixing that.
<p>
The reason why we can turn what were originally import_module declarations
into use_module declarations
is that we generate the .int file at all
only if we can successfully module qualify everything in it
(actually, everything in the augmented compilation unit
from which we derive the .int file's contents).
<em>XXX</em>
This is not quite true.
A compiler invocation that cannot fully module qualify
the augmented compilation unit
when trying to generate an interface file
will exit with a nonzero exit status,
so technically it fails,
but it will still generate the interface file.
<em>XXX</em>
XXX We should consider fixing that.
In fact, if we cannot generate an interface file correctly,
we should delete the file we would have overwritten (if it exists)
as well as its timestamp file (again, if it exists).
</ul>

<h2>The contents of .int2 files</h2>

<p>
The contents of the .int2 file of a module are derived
from the contents of the module's .int file.
This means that indirectly, it is derived from
both the interface sections and the implementation sections of that module,
<em>after</em> they are fully module qualified,
which requires reading in various interface files of various other modules
(see the section on .int files above for details).
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Type definitions in the interface section
are copied <em>from the .int file</em> (not the source file)
with two changes:
    <ul>
    <li>
    discriminated and solver types are made abstract
    (though solver type definitions in interface sections
    ought to be abstract in the first place), and
    <li>
    if the type has user-specified unification and/or comparison predicates,
    the part of the type definition naming those predicates is deleted.
    </ul>
<p>
We keep a type definition in the implementation section
if the type constructor being defined
satisfies any of the following conditions:
XXX this seems wrong
    <ul>
    <li>
    Type definitions in the implementation section
    are copied <em>from the .int file</em> (not the source file) unchanged.
    These should only be used when making decisions
    about the representations of the types defined in the interface.
    We already compute exactly which nonexported types
    we need definitions for in the implementation section, and what form,
    for the .int2 file;
    we need exactly the same info for the same purpose in .int2 files.
    In both cases, we should need these
    only until we switch to using type_repn items instead.
    </ul>
<p>
<li>
Inst and mode definitions in the interface
are always included in the .int2 file
in exactly the same form as in the .int file.
<p>
<em>XXX</em>
It should eventually be possible to make abstract
any inst and mode definitions that do not refer to any other modules
(other than the public or private builtin modules,
though the private one does not define any insts or modes).
This is because the only thing that
code using such an inst or mode can do with it
is pass it to a predicate or function defined in the same module.
However, until recently the compiler
did not handle abstract insts and modes at all, and even now,
the only thing they can be used for reliably is module qualification;
pretty much all operations on abstract insts and modes
will cause a compiler abort.
<p>
<li>
Class definitions in the interface
are always included in the .int2 file with the methods deleted.
Class definitions in the implementation
are never included in the .int2 file.
<em>XXX Why?</em>
<p>
<li>
Instance definitions in the interface
are always included in the .int2 file with the methods deleted.
Instance definitions in the implementation
are never included in the .int2 file.
<p>
<li>
The type and mode declarations of predicates and functions
are never included in the .int2 file,
whether they occur in the interface or the implementation.
<p>
<li>
Clauses are never included in .int2 files.
<p>
<li>
Pragmas are never included in .int2 files.
<p>
<li>
Promises are never included in .int2 files.
<p>
<li>
Mutables are never included in .int2 files.
<p>
<li>
Initialize and finalize declarations are never included in .int2 files.
<p>
<li>
Declarations of submodules in the interface section
are always included in the .int2 file.
Declarations of submodules in the implementation section
are never included in the .int2 file.
<em>XXX Why?</em>
Until we switch to using type_repn items, the second part may be a bug.
If an abstract-exported type is defined to be equivalent
to a type that is defined in a submodule in the interface,
then the equivalence type_defn we will include
in the .int2 file's implementation section
will refer to the submodule
<em>without</em> seeing the include_module declaration.
<p>
<li>
We copy an explicit foreign_import_module item
from the interface of the source file
to the interface of the .int2 file
if we include in the interface of the .int2 file
a foreign type definition
for the target language mentioned in that foreign_import_module item.
We put an implicit foreign_import_module item for the current module
into the interface of the .int2 file
for every target language mentioned in such a foreign_type definition.
<p>
We copy explicit an foreign_import_module item
from the interface <em>or</em> the implementation section of the source file
to the implementation section of the .int2 file
if we include in the implementation section of the .int2 file
a foreign type definition
for the target language mentioned in that foreign_import_module item.
Likewise,
we put an implicit foreign_import_module item for the current module
into the implementation section of the .int2 file
for every target language mentioned in a foreign_type definition
in the implementation section of the .int2 file.
<p>
As with .int files,
there is one exception from the above.
If the interface section of the .int2 file contains
a foreign_import_module for a given module in a given target language,
then the compiler won't include
a copy of the same foreign_import_module item in the implementation section,
either explicitly or implicitly.
<p>
<li>
We never put any import_module declarations
in the interface section of the .int2 file,
nor do we ever put any import_module or use_module declarations
in the implementation section of the .int2 file,
We <em>do</em> put a use_module declaration
into the interface section of the .int2 file
for all of the modules that have an import_module and/or use_module declaration
in the module's interface section,
<em>and</em>
which are referred to by one of the
type, inst, mode, typeclass or instance definitions in the interface,
in one of the following ways:
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    if the module defines a type that occurs
    on the right hand side of the definition of an equivalence type;
    <li>
    if the module defines a type constructor
    that is mentioned as being the type an inst is for;
    <li>
    if the module defines an inst or a mode
    that occurs in the right hand side of the definition of an inst or a mode;
    <li>
    if the module defines a typeclass or a type constructor
    that occurs in a superclass constraint on a typeclass definition; or
    <li>
    if the module defines a typeclass or a type constructor
    that an instance definition is for,
    or a typeclass or a type constructor
    that occurs in a class constraint on an instance definition.
    </ul>
<p>
As mentioned above in .int file section,
the reason why we need use_module declarations for these modules
is that the compiler creates entries
for e.g. the types we are imported from them
only when it sees them defined, not when it sees them used.
<p>
And as was also mentioned above in .int file section,
the reason why we can turn what were originally import_module declarations
into use_module declarations
is that we generate the .int2 file at all
only if we can successfully module qualify everything in it
(actually, everything in the augmented compilation unit
from which we derive the .int2 file's contents).
</ul>

<h2>Inclusion property</h2>

<p>
A module's .int, .int2 and .int3 files
are supposed to maintain the property that
<ul>
<li>
every piece of information that is in items in the .int3 file
is also in the .int2 file, and
<li>
every piece of information that is in items in the .int2 file
is also in the .int file.
</ul>
<p>
This is implicit in the fact that
the algorithm we use to read in interface files (in grab_modules.m)
never reads in a .int2 file if it has read in that module's .int file, and
never reads in a .int3 file if it has read in that module's .int or .int2 file.
In fact, making this possible is the reason why
it reads in .int files first, .int2 files next, and .int3 files last.
<p>
I (zs) don't see any inclusion requirements being placed on .int0 files.
However, grab_modules.m does have to read in its ancestors'.int0 files first,
because the set of .int files it needs to read includes
not just the .int files of the modules imported by the current module,
but also the .int files of the modules imported by its ancestors.
<p>
Note that the inclusion property
does not apply to import_module and use_module declarations.
While .int and .int2 files contain only use_module declarations,
.int3 files contain only import_module declarations,
which can be considered more expressive,
and .int3 files may contain import_module declarations for modules
for which the corresponding .int and/or .int2 files
do <em>not</em> contain use_module declarations.
This is because in the absence of errors,
.int and .int2 files are always fully module qualified,
which is something we cannot insist on for .int3 files.
This difference is
<ul>
<li>
why .int and .int2 files can avoid importing or using
modules that they do not refer to, and
<li>
why .int and .int2 files can use, not import,
modules that they do refer to.
</ul>
<p>
Consumers of .int3 files need import_module declarations
because they need to <em>find</em>
which module defines an entity, such as a type constructor;
consumers of .int and .int2 files need only use_module declarations
because they need only to <em>look up</em>
the definition of that entity.
<p>
That definition should be needed only in two cases.
First, the case of type definitions,
we may need to follow chains of type equivalences to the end
in order to make decisions about type representations involving that type.
Second, the case of inst and mode definitions,
we may likewise need to follow chains of equivalences to the end
in order to figure out the exact expansions of named insts and modes,
which we may need for mode analysis.

<h2>Timestamp files</h2>

<ul>
<li>
The datestamp on the .date3 file gives the last time
the .int3 file was checked for consistency.
<li>
The datestamp on the .date0 file gives the last time
the .int0 file was checked for consistency.
<li>
The datestamp on the .date file gives the last time
the .int and .int2 files were checked for consistency.
</ul>

% This module transforms sequences of goals in procedure bodies. It looks for
% a unification that constructs a ground term followed by primitive goals, at
% least one of which can fail, and none of which take the variable
% representing the cell as their input. Such code sequences cause the cell to
% be constructed even if the following goal would fail, which is wasteful.
% This module therefore reorders the sequence, moving the construction
% unification past all the semidet primitives it can.
%
% The reason we don't move the construction past calls or composite goals is
% that this may require storing the input arguments of the construction on the
% stack, which may cause a slowdown bigger than the speedup available from not
% having to construct the cell on some execution paths.

% We maintain a list of delayed construction unifications that construct
% ground terms, and the set of variables they define.
%
% When we find other construction unifications, we add them to the list.
% It does not matter if they depend on other delayed construction unifications;
% when we put them back into the conjunction, we do so in the original order.
%
% There are several reasons why we may not be able to delay a construction
% unification past a conjunct. The conjunct may not be a primitive goal, or it
% may be impure; in either case, we must insert all the delayed construction
% unifications before it. The conjunct may also require the value of a
% variable defined by a construction unification. In such cases, we could drop
% before that goal only the construction unifications that define the
% variables needed by the conjunct, either directly or indirectly through the
% values required by some of those construction unifications. However,
% separating out this set of delayed constructions from the others would
% require somewhat complex code, and it is not clear that there would be any
% significant benefit. We therefore insert *all* the delayed constructions
% before a goal if the goal requires *any* of the variables bound by the
% constructions.
%
% The instmap we pass around is the one that we construct from the original
% conjunction order. At each point, it reflects the bindings made by the
% conjuncts so far *plus* the bindings made by the delayed goals.

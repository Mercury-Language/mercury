        % In such a situation, if the value of the switched-on variable
        % is ConsId, then execution cannot reach the end of the first switch.
        % Mode analysis will notice this fact before the compiler even
        % discovers that the first switch *is* a switch, when it is still
        % a disjunction. It will generate a warning about the unification
        % of the same switched-on variable with ConsId in the disjunction
        % that would turn into the second switch, and then delete that
        % unification. So when switch detection gets around to that
        % disjunction, it won't have a unification with ConsId to make
        % ConsId one of the cons_ids of a switch arm. This means if execution
        % gets here, then this possibility cannot actually have happened.
        %
        % For an example of this, have a look at the HLDS dumps of
        % tests/hard_coded/bug570_can_fail.m from just before and just after
        % the mode checking pass.
        %
        % The second possibility is that the first switch is a cannot_fail
        % switch, but the inst of the switched-on variable at its start
        % implies that the switched-on variable *cannot* be bound to ConsId
        % there. Again, if the user writes code like this, the compiler will
        % notice that the unification of the switched-on variable with ConsId
        % in the disjunction that would turn into the second switch cannot
        % succeed, generate a warning, and then delete that unification.
        % This again would mean that execution cannot get here.
        %
        % However, there is a way in which execution *can* get here:
        % if the code sequence containing the two switches, the first
        % not having a ConsId arm but the second having such an arm,
        % is constructed internally by the compiler *after* the mode analysis
        % pass. This happens in tests/hard_coded/bug570, where this
        % construction is done by the deforestation pass, which then
        % invokes simplification on its output.
        %
        % The map.search above used to be a map.lookup, but that test case
        % showed that it must be a map.search. The make_headers predicate in
        % bug570.m consists of three successive switches on the same variable,
        % Prepare, all of which handle all the function symbols of Prepare's
        % type. Deforestation moves copies of those switches into each arm
        % of the previous switch. In their new positions in the arms of the
        % first switch, some arms of the copied second switch become
        % unreachable, and are pruned away. Mantis bug #570 happened when
        % deforestation tried to move copies of the third switch, which had
        % an arm for Prepare = prepare_edit, into each arm of the merged
        % first/second switch, one of which occurred in a context in which
        % Prepare could *not* be bound to prepare_edit, because it was derived
        % from the arm of the first switch on Prepare which was *not*
        % prepare_edit.

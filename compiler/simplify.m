% The two jobs of the simplification package are
%
% - to find and exploit opportunities for simplifying the internal form
%   of the program, both to optimize the code and to massage the code
%   into a form the code generator will accept, and
%
% - to warn the programmer about any constructs that look suspicious.
%
% Originally, we warned only about code that was so simple that
% it should not have been included in the program in the first place
% (such as if-then-elses whose conditions cannot fail), but we now
% also warn about other things as well, such as mismatches between
% format strings and the values supplied to be printed.

% We export simplify_tasks because it defines the type that
% clients of simplify use to tell simplify what tasks to perform.
:- include_module simplify_tasks.
% We export simplify_proc because it exports the predicates that
% clients of simplify call to invoke simplify.
:- include_module simplify_proc.
% We export format_call because the presence of calls in a procedure
% that format_call needs to check (and may be able to optimize) is noticed
% by code outside the simplify package, in determinism analysis.
% (We could have simplify look for such calls itself, but that would require
% an extra traversal of every procedure.)

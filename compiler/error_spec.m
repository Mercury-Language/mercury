% Every distinct problem should generate a single error specification.
% This specification should state
%
% - the severity of the problem (so that we can update the exit status
%   of the compiler accordingly),
% - which phase of the compiler found the problem (since later phases
%   may wish to suppress some problem reports if some specific earlier phases
%   found problems, e.g. when a missing clause could be caused
%   by a syntax error), and
% - a specification of what to print.
%
% In most cases, the "what to print" will be a single message for a single
% context. However, we may want to print messages for several contexts.
% For example, when reporting a duplicate declaration, we want to report
% this fact in the duplicate declaration's context, while printing another
% message giving the original declaration's context.
%
% simplest_spec(Id, Severity, Phase, Context, Pieces) is a shorthand for
% (and equivalent in every respect to) error_spec(Id, Severity, Phase,
% [simple_msg(Context, always(Pieces)])]).
%
% conditional_spec(Id, Option, MatchValue, Severity, Phase, Msgs) is intended
% to represent the error specification given by its last three fields
% *iff* Option has the value MatchValue. If Option is *not* MatchValue,
% it asks for nothing to be printed, and for the exit status to be left alone.
%
% The id field, which is present in all three alternatives, is totally
% ignored when printing error_specs. Its job is something completely different:
% helping developers track down where in the source code each error_spec
% was constructed. Without the id fields, if developers wants to know this,
% e.g. because they do not want the message printed, or because there is
% a problem with its wording, they have to grep for some words in the message.
% However, grepping for a single word will usually get many false hits,
% while grepping for two or more consecutive words in the message may miss
% the code generating the message, because in that code, some of those
% consecutive words are on different lines. On the other hand, if every
% place that constructs an error_spec, of any of these three varieties,
% fills in the id field with $pred, then finding the right place is easy:
% just specify the developer-only option --print-error-spec-id, and
% the identity of the predicate or function that generated each error_spec
% will be output just after the messages in that error_spec. Even if the
% predicate or function that this identifies has several pieces of code
% that construct specs, the scope in which you have to search for it
% will be easily manageable.

% An error message may have several components that may be printed under
% different circumstances. Some components are always printed; some are
% printed only if specific options have specific values. When an error
% specification is printed, we concatenate the list of all the
% format_pieces that should be printed. If this yields the empty list,
% we print nothing. Otherwise, we give them all to write_error_pieces to print
% out.
%
% When we print an error message in a list of error messages, we normally
% treat the first line of the first message differently than the rest:
% we separate it from the context by one space, whereas following lines
% are separated by three spaces. You can request that the first line of
% a message be treated as it were the first, even if it is not, by setting
% the error_treat_as_first field to "always_treat_as_first". You can also
% request that the pieces in a message be given extra indentation by setting
% the error_extra_indent field to a strictly positive value.

% This module provides utility types and predicates that are useful
% when compiler modules process from_ground_term scopes.
%
% Specifically, the contents of this module are designed
% to help test whether after a program transformation,
% a from_ground_term_{initial,construct} scope goal can still remain
% a from_ground_term scope of the same kind, and if not, to wrap smaller
% from_ground_term_{initial,construct} scopes around subsequences of the
% original conjuncts whereever the status of the invariants permit it.

# for building the Mercury implementation that is shared
# between all the subdirectories.  It also contains all
# the parameters that might need to be modified when installing
# Mercury on a new machine.

# These parameters should all be determined automatically by `configure'.
# Any definitions in the Mmake.params file take precedence over the
# definitions here, so if you want to change one of the values here
# it is best to just add a definition to Mmake.params.

# with the new mode checker.
# To disable the Aditi support, put `INCLUDE_ADITI_OUTPUT = no'
# in Mmake.stage.params. Do not put this into Mmake.params - we still
# want to check that the Aditi code compiles after any changes.

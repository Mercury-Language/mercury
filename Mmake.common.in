# Mmake.common - this is the part of the makefiles
# for building the Mercury implementation that is shared
# between all the subdirectories.  It also contains all
# the parameters that might need to be modified when installing
# Mercury on a new machine.

# These parameters should all be determined automatically by `configure'.
# Any definitions in the Mmake.params file take precedence over the
# definitions here, so if you want to change one of the values here
# it is best to just add a definition to Mmake.params.

# Specify the locations for installing things.
# These directories can all be modified independantly.
# In particular, you might want to find a better place for the DVI and
# HTML files.

# FINAL_INSTALL_PREFIX describes the directory that the installation
# will finally end up in. It should only be set by the configure 
# script.  Other FINAL_INSTALL_* variables have a similar meaning.
#
# If you want to install to a different directory temporarily (e.g.
# to build a package, or if you don't have the permissions to install
# to a final directory), override INSTALL_PREFIX on the command-line.
# If you have previously configured to the directory you want to
# finally install to, you will then be able to move the files safely,
# since any hard-coded paths will be set to their final destination
# already (note that the installation in the temporary directory may
# not work until moved into its final destination).
# e.g.
#      configure --prefix /usr
#      make INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/temporary/directory/usr

# If you don't intend to install to a temporary directory, rather than
# overriding INSTALL_PREFIX you should reconfigure using the configure
# script, since there are some hardcoded paths created by the configure
# script (e.g. in the shell scripts mmc, ml, mmake, etc) that will not
# be updated simply by overriding INSTALL_PREFIX.

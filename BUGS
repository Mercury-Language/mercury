  * the version of Mercury;
  * the system type;

  * the command line flags with which the Mercury compiler was invoked;
  * the name and version of the C compiler that you are using;

Please try to ensure that bug report contains all the information that we need to
be able to reproduce the problem.  Make sure that all bug reports are fully
self-contained.

Some known problems related to using Mercury on specific operating systems are
described in the README.* files. See also the LIMITATIONS.md file.

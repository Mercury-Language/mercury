This directory contains the package `mercury_glfw', which is a Mercury binding
to the GLFW (See: <http://www.glfw.org>).

Building the binding
====================

(1) Fill in the system-specific information for your GLFW installation
    in the file GLFW.options.

(2) Build and install using the following command:

    $ mmc --make libmercury_glfw.install


Overview of the binding
=======================

The Mercury GLFW binding provides access to  all of version 2.7 of GLFW API
with the exception of:

   * the GLFW thread routines                   (use Mercury threads instead)
   * the image and texture loading routines     (deprecated)
   * the routines for handling OpenGL extensions

The mapping between GLFW functions and the corresponding Mercury predicates 
in the binding is straightforward, for example:

   C                                    Mercury
   ---------                            -------
   glfwInit()                           glfw.init/2
   glfwOpenWindow()                     glfw.open_window/11
   glfwSetWindowRefreshCallback()       glfw.set_window_refresh_callback/3
   glfwPollEvents()                     glfw.poll_events/2

Unless otherwise noted, you may assume the specified given in the GLFW
reference manual.

For each type of callback, we provide an "unset" predicate for removing a
previously registered callback.

The "examples" subdirectory contains a number of examples that demonstrate how
to use the binding.  To build them you will also require the `mercury_opengl'
package.

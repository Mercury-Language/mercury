This is a fairly complete Mercury binding for the Allegro game programming
library and the AllegroGL addon library.

	http://alleg.sourceforge.net/
	http://allegrogl.sourceforge.net/

The API follows the C APIs as far as is reasonable, so you don't need to learn
a new API.  Build it by running `make' or `make agl' if you additionally have
AllegroGL installed.  You will need Allegro 4.2.x-4.4.x (4.1.x may also work).
It has currently only been tested on Linux.

The subdirectories are:

examples/
	Contains ports of some of the Allegro examples to Mercury.

samples/
	Contains a few more substantial programs, such as a port of the
	Allegro demo game, an (incomplete) port of Shawn Hargreaves'
	SPEED game, and some others.

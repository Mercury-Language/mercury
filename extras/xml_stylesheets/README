This directory contains some example stylesheets for use with the term_to_xml
library module.

You can apply a stylesheet to an XML document using the program xsltproc
(available from http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT) or any other XSLT tool.  You can also
include a reference to the stylesheet in the XML document and have your browser
apply the stylesheet, although this only works with some browsers.

mercury_term.xsl
	Stylesheet to convert an XML document generated with 
	term_to_xml.write_xml_doc/6 back to a Mercury term suitable for reading
	with io.read/3.

xul_tree.xsl
	Stylesheet to convert an XML document generated with 
	term_to_xml.write_xml_doc/6 to a XUL tree structure suitable for
	browsing with Mozilla or Firefox.

html_234tree.xsl
	Converts a 234 tree (as defined in the standard library) to an XHTML
	table.  The paths of each key and value are also shown.  This
	is useful for looking up values or keys in 234 trees (which are used
	to implement the `map' standard library type) from the 
	debugger by using the search facilities of your web browser, 
	although it's impractical for very large 234 trees and doesn't work
	with nested 234 trees.

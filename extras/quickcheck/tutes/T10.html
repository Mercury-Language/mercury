<h3> Summary - Generators </h3>
<pre>

Quickcheck is able to generate random values for each input 
argument at run time, provided that there is a default/custom 
generator for that type. The master seed for randomness is the
current time.

Quickcheck generates value via the following steps:

	1	The master generator is called with 7 arguments.
		Arg1	type_desc of the required term
		Arg2	SF for the current term
		Arg3	a list of all GF
		Arg4	a list of all custom generators
		Arg5	ouputs a univ of the generated term  
		Arg6	random number supply input
		Arg7	random number supply output

	2a	Quickcheck searches through the list of custom generators,
		if there is a custum generator for the current term, then
		call the custom generator with Arg1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
		The master generator will return what ever is returned by the 
		custom generator.

 	2b	If Quickcheck fails to locate a custom generator, then it will
		classify the current term as of type int, char, float, string,
		discriminated union, and other.
	
  	3b1	If it's type int, call rand_int/2 with Arg6 and Arg7
	
	3b2	If it's type char, call rand_char/2 with Arg6 and Arg7		
			
	3b3	If it's type float, call rand_float/2 with Arg6 and Arg7

	3b4	If it's type string, call rand_string/2 with Arg6 and Arg8

	3b5	If it's type discriminated union, call rand_union/6 with 
		Arg1, Arg2, Arg3, Arg4, Arg6, Arg7.
		
	3b6	If it's classified as other, then call rand_function with Arg1,
		Arg6 and Arg7. Quickcheck will generates the appropriate value if  
		Arg1 is of a function with arity 0 to 10. Otherwise an error will
		be thrown :
			"no default generator for this type"

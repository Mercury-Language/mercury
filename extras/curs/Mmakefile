# To build, do the following:
#
# Check that the values in the file Ncurses.options are appropriate
# for linking against ncurses on your system.
# Then do:
#
#     $ mmake depend
#     $ mmake
#
# And to install...
#
#     $ mmake install

# Omit this line if you want to install in the standard location.
# Edit this line if you want to install the library elsewhere.
# A directory $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/lib/mercury will be created, if
# necessary, and everything put there.
#
#INSTALL_PREFIX = $(HOME)/mercury

# Edit this line if you want to install with different grades.

# Any application using this library will also need the following
# in its Mmakefile:

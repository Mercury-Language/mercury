This directory contains various additional libraries, tools,
and so forth that are not part of the Mercury standard library.

cgi		A couple of Mercury library modules for doing HTML forms
		programming using CGI (Common Gateway Interface).

clpr		A Mercury interface to the CLP(R) constraint solver,
		for solving arithmetic constraints on (floating point)
		real numbers.

complex_numbers
		A Mercury library package containing support for
		complex and imaginary numbers.

curses		A Mercury library providing a (partial) binding to 
		curses; a package that provides methods for manipulating
		the text screen (creating windows, placing characters, etc).

dynamic_linking
		An interface to the C functions dlopen(), dlsym(), etc.
		that are supported by most modern Unix systems.

exceptions	A library module containing a (tentative)
		exception handling interface for Mercury.

graphics	A couple of packages for doing graphics programming
		and GUIs in Mercury: a Mercury interface to tcl/tk
		and a Mercury binding to OpenGL.

lazy_evaluation
		A library module `lazy' containing support for optional
		lazy evaluation in Mercury, together with some examples
		of its use, including a module `lazy_list' that defines
		a lazy list data type.

moose		A parser generator for Mercury.  Moose works much like
		yacc or bison, it takes a grammar and generates a table
		driven LALR parser for it.  You can add code to the
		grammar to handle synthesized or inherited attributes.
		Currently you need to write your own lexer to interface
		to moose.

odbc		A Mercury interface to ODBC (Open Database Connectivity),
		for interfacing to standard relational database packages.

references	A library package containing modules for manipulating
		ML-style references (mutable state).

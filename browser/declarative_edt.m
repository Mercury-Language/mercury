%
% This module defines Evaluation Dependency Trees (EDTs), which represent the
% dependencies between calls made during the execution of a buggy program.
% Search spaces are also defined as a layer on top of EDTs.
%
% The search space records extra information like which nodes have been
% eliminated from the bug search, which nodes have been skipped or are
% trusted, the weight of each node, and in future might also store information
% like the probability of each node being buggy, based on some heuristic(s).
%
% The search space provides a consistent view of the debug tree - combining
% separately generated EDT subtrees into one tree. Each node in the search
% space corresponds to a node either explicitly represented in a generated EDT
% subtree or the root of an implicitly represented EDT subtree. We maintain
% the invariant that search space nodes always correspond with explicit nodes
% where an explicit version of the EDT subtree containing that node exists, and
% only correspond to implicit roots when an explicit version of the EDT subtree
% rooted at the node has not yet been generated.
%
% Every node in the EDT may not have a corresponding node in the search space:
% nodes are only added to the search space when they are needed by a
% particular search algorithm.
%
% By convention, nodes in the search space are referred to as `suspects', while
% nodes in the EDT are referred to as `EDT nodes', or just `nodes'.
%
% Also we use the term "root" to refer to the root of the smallest subtree in
% the search space that must contain a bug based on the answers received so
% far, and the term "topmost" for the suspect in the search space with the
% lowest depth.
%
% Each suspect in the search space can be assigned a weight to be used for
% divide and query search. Any heuristic can be used, as long as the combined
% weight of all the children of a suspect does not exceed the suspect's own
% weight. Sometimes, the weight may depend on the weights of unmaterialized
% portions of the EDT, resulting in the situation where the combined weight of
% the children of a suspect exceeds the parent's weight. If this happens then
% an "excess weight" may be specified along with the normal weight which will
% be added to all the ancestor's of the overweight suspect. For example if the
% number of events in descendant suspects is being used as a weight, then for a
% FAIL node some events may be repeated in siblings of the FAIL node. In this
% case the duplicate events might not have been included in the ancestor's
% weights, so should be added.
%
% When debugging, a search space consistency check can be turned on by
% compiling with the C macro MR_DD_CHECK_SEARCH_SPACE defined (i.e. by
% putting "EXTRA_CFLAGS=-DMR_DD_CHECK_SEARCH_SPACE" in Mmake.browser.params).

    % This typeclass defines how EDTs may be accessed by this module.
    % An EDT is a tree of nodes, each of which contains a question about
    % the truth of an assertion. The children of a node may not be immediately
    % accessible if the sub-tree beneath that node is represented implicitly.
    % In this case, the analyser must request that it be made explicit
    % before continuing.
    %
    % The first argument is intuitively a "store", which maps references
    % to the things they reference. The second argument is the type of trees
    % themselves. By convention, we use the names S and T for type variables
    % which are constrained by mercury_edt.
    %
    % By convention, we also use the names S and T in type declarations
    % where it is *intended* that the type variables be constrained by
    % mercury_edt.

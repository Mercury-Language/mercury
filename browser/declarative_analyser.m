% This module implements some analysis algorithms that search for bugs in
% Evaluation Dependency Trees (EDTs). The search algorithms use information
% provided by the search_space data type which acts as a layer on top of the
% EDT, storing information relevant to the bug search. Throughout this module
% the type variables T and S refer to the types of nodes in the EDT and the
% store of EDT nodes respectively.

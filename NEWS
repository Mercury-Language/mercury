NEWS since Mercury 14.01
------------------------

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have added the print_line and write_line family of predicates to the
  io module.  These behave like the print and write predicates, but also
  write a terminating newline character.

* io.print and string_writer.print now print arbitrary precision integers
  in their decimal form instead of printing their underlying representation.

Changes to the extras distribution:

* We have added support for Unicode and other enhancements to the lex and
  regex libraries.  Thanks to Sebastian Godelet.


NEWS for Mercury 14.01
----------------------

Changes to the Mercury language:

* Repeated type variables may now occur in the heads of type class instances.
  For example, instance declarations like the following are now allowed:

      :- instance foo(list(T), map(T, T)).

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have added the function cord.condense/1.

* The following functions in the standard library's cord module now use
  constant stack space: foldl/3, foldl_pred/4.

* We have added the following predicates to the array and version_array
  modules: is_empty/1, all_true/2 and all_false/2.

* We have added the following predicates and functions to the map module:
  det_min_key/1, det_max_key/1, foldl2_values/6 and foldl3_values/8.

* We have added the following predicates to the list module: foldr2/6,
  foldr3/8, det_take/3 and map_foldr/5.

* We have added the following predicates to the bag module: foldl/4 and
  foldl2/6.

* We have added the following predicates to the assoc_list module:
  foldl2_values/6 and foldl3_values/8.

* We have added the following predicates and functions to the pqueue module:
  is_empty/1, peek/3, peek_key/2, peek_value/2, det_peek/3, merge/3,
  det_peek_key/1 and det_peek_value/1.

* We have added the predicate bimap.equal/2.

* We have added the following predicates to the int module: fold_up3/9 and
  fold_down3/9.

Changes to the Mercury compiler:

* On Mac OS X systems the compiler is now configured use the version of the
  host system as the default value for the deployment target.

  A new configuration option, `--with-macosx-deployment-target', allows
  an alternative value to be selected at configuration time.

Portability improvements:

* We have made the implementation compatible with GCC 4.8 and Visual Studio
  2013.

* We have made the implementation compatible with OS X 10.9.

Changes to the extras distribution:

* We've added a library that provides support for accessing the function
  trail from Mercury code.

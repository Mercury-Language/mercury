NEWS for Mercury release 0.5
----------------------------

* We now support committed choice nondeterminism in a logical and declarative
  fashion, using the new determinism categories `cc_nondet' and `cc_multi'.
  Like `nondet' and `multi' respectively, they specify that a predicate
  may have more than one solution, but they convey the additional
  assertion that the predicate will only be used in contexts in which
  only one solution is needed.  The compiler will check that all uses
  of the predicate satisfy this requirement.  Having proven the
  assertion to be correct, the compiler can then generate much more
  efficient code for the predicate.  By pushing pruning inwards, the
  compiler can often avoid creating choice points at all.

* We now check for backtracking over unique modes.
  (This may potentially break some programs using unique modes in ways
  that the compiler can't prove are safe; if you have any trouble
  with this, we'll be happy to help you.)
  We have also added "mostly unique" modes, which provide support
  for backtrackable destructive update.
  See the Mercury language reference manual.

* We now provide genuinue arrays with destructive update.
  See the library module `uniq_array'.  (Warning: this has not had
  much testing.  The interface is not yet stable.)

* We now support interfacing to C code.
  See the documentation in the Mercury language reference manual.

* There is now an `inline' pragma which you can use as a hint to the
  compiler to inline a particular predicate.

* We've ported the system to ULTRIX (thanks to Gertjan van Noord
  and especially Eero Pajarre).

* We now support shared libraries for IRIX 5.

* We now allow the use of compilers other than gcc -
  see the user's guide for details.
  We don't recommend the use of compilers other than gcc,
  since the inability to use gcc's special features will
  most likely lead to much less efficient code.

* To complement our source distribution, we now also provide binary
  distributions for a variety of platforms.  Installation should be
  quick and easy.

* Various other minor improvements:
  - In portable C mode, we now generate better code for loops.
  - We've made a few other minor improvements in the generated code.
  - Unary plus and minus are now implemented.
  - Updated the documentation to reflect changes in unique modes,
  - Corrected a lot of typos in the documentation.
  - Fixed quite a few bugs.

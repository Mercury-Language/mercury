NEWS since Mercury 20.01.x
==========================

Changes that may break compatibility
------------------------------------

* We have deleted the `one_or_more` type, and the operations on it, from
  the `list` module of the Mercury standard library, and moved them to
  a new module named `one_or_more`. This will break compatibility for
  code that used the moved functionality, but such breaks can be fixed
  simply by importing `one_or_more` as well as (or in rare cases, instead of)
  the `list` module.

* If module A contains a `:- import_module` or a `:- use_module` declaration
  for module B but does not refer to anything defined in module B, we used
  to generate a warning for the declaration only if module A had no submodules,
  because it is possible that A's submodules refer to entities defined in B.
  We now generate a warning for unused `:- import_module` and `:- use_module`
  declaration in this case as well, which will stop the program from compiling
  if `--halt-at-warn` is set. The fix is simple: replace the declaration
  being warned about in the parent module with declarations in the child
  modules that need it. In the fairly frequent case that not all child modules
  need module B, this avoids the need to recompile those child modules
  when the interface of module B changes.

Changes to the Mercury standard library
---------------------------------------

### New module: `kv_list`

* This module, whose name is short for key-value list, contains the same
  functionality as the existing `assoc_list` module, but stores lists of
  key-value pairs in a more space-efficient manner. Specifically, it uses
  one three-word cell on the heap to represent each pair, while the
  `assoc_list` module uses two two-word cells, which means that `kv_list`
  will allocate fewer heap cells. The tradeoff is that unlike assoc_lists,
  kv_lists are not standard lists, and thus cannot be manipulated
  using the functions and predicates of the `list` module.

### New module: `one_or_more`

* This module defines the `one_or_more` type, which represents nonempty lists,
  and provides operations on the values of this type. For every operation
  in the `list` module that makes sense for nonempty lists, there is a
  corresponding operation in `one_or_more`.

### New module: `one_or_more_map`

* This module implements `one_or_more_map`, a map from keys to one or more
  values. Its functionality is very similar to that of the `multi_map` module
  (in fact, the two modules define the exact same set of operations),
  but unlike `multi_map`, it uses the type system to enforce the invariant
  that every key in the map must have at least one associated value.

### New module: `thread.closeable_channel`

* This module implements closeable unbounded channels, similar to the unbounded
  channels provided by the `thread.channel` module, but with the addition of a
  close operation. Once a channel is closed, no more items can be added to it,
  and reading from a closed channel will not block indefinitely.

### Changes to the `assoc_list` module

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - pred `lookup/3`
    - pred `update/4`
    - pred `foldl/4`
    - pred `foldl2/6`
    - pred `foldl3/8`
    - func `foldl_keys/3`
    - func `foldl_values/3`

### Changes to the `char` module

* The following function and predicate have been added:

    - func `hash/1`
    - pred `hash/2`

### Changes to the `float` module

* The following predicate has been added:

    - pred `hash/2`

### Changes to the `hash_table` module

* The following predicates have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release:

    - pred `int_hash/2`
    - pred `uint_hash/2`
    - pred `float_hash/2`
    - pred `char_hash/2`
    - pred `string_hash/2`
    - pred `generic_hash/2`

* The following obsolete functions have been removed:

    - func `new/3`
    - func `new_default/1`

### Changes to the `int` module

* The following function and predicate have been added:

    - func `hash/1`
    - pred `hash/2`

### Changes to the `list` module

* The following predicate has been added:

    - pred `map_corresponding3/5`

* The following type, functions and predicates have been moved to the
  new `one_or_more` module. Note: this change can break backwards
  compatibility.

    - type `one_or_more/1`
    - func `one_or_more_cons/2`     (as `one_or_more.cons/2`)
    - func `one_or_more_to_list/1`
    - pred `list_to_one_or_more/2`
    - pred `det_list_to_one_or_more/2`

### Changes to the `map` module

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - pred `filter_map_values/3`
    - pred `filter_map_values_only/3`
    - pred `foldl4_values/10`
    - pred `foldl5_values/12`
    - func `keys_as_set/1`
    - pred `keys_as_set/2`

### Changes to the `multi_map` module

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - func `sorted_keys/1`
    - pred `sorted_keys/2`
    - func `keys_as_set/1`
    - pred `keys_as_set/2`

### Changes to the `stream` module

* We have added a new `reader/4` subclass, `unboxed_reader/4`. This subclass
  allows readers to provide a `get` operation that avoids boxing non-error
  outputs.

### Changes to the `thread.channel` module

* The following predicate has been deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release:

    - pred `untake/4`

### Changes to the `thread.mvar` module

* The documentation of the following predicates has been clarified to match the
  actual implementation:

    - pred `try_take/4`
    - pred `try_read/4`

### Changes to the `tree234` module

* The following predicates have been added:

    - pred `filter_map_values/3`
    - pred `filter_map_values_only/3`
    - pred `foldl4_values/10`
    - pred `foldl5_values/12`

### Changes to the `uint` module

* The following function and predicate have been added:

    - func `hash/1`
    - pred `hash/2`

### Changes to the `version_array` module

* The following obsolete function has been removed:

    - func `unsafe_new/2`

### Changes to the `version_hash_table` module

* The following predicates have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release:

    - pred `int_hash/2`
    - pred `uint_hash/2`
    - pred `float_hash/2`
    - pred `char_hash/2`
    - pred `string_hash/2`
    - pred `generic_hash/2`

Changes to the Mercury compiler
-------------------------------

### Changes to the treatment of unused imports

* The compiler now generates warnings for `:- import_module` and
  `:- use_module` declarations in the interface of a module even if
  that module has submodules. Previously, it generated such warnings
  only if the module had no submodules.

### Changes to code model options

* `--trail-segments`

  Grades that support trailing now always use trail segments. This means
  that the `--trail-segments` option now has no effect, and it is therefore
  deprecated.

* `--high-level-data`

  We have deleted the `--high-level-data` option. Its effects are now
  implied by the target language.

* `--tags`

  We have deleted the `--tags` option. Its effects are now implied
  by the target language.

### Changes to warnings

* [Github issue #85]. The compiler will now generate a warning about
  a disjunct that cannot succeed even if the predicate or function in which
  that disjunct occurs has other modes in which that disjunct can succeed.

  The generation of such warnings can now be disabled by wrapping
  the whole disjunction, or a larger goal containing it, in a
  `disable_warnings` scope, like this:

        disable_warnings [no_solution_disjunct] (
           Goal
        )

* [Mantis bug #497]. The compiler will now generate a warning for an
  unrecognised warning name in a `disable_warnings` scope instead of
  reporting an error.

### New warning options

* `--print-errors-warnings-when-generating-interface`

  Until now, the compiler did not try to detect problems with a module
  when generating its interface files. Now it does. To preserve compatibility,
  by default it still ignores any problems it finds then, but if this option
  is enabled, and if it does in fact find any problems, the compiler will
  report them, and if they are severe enough, it will not generate the
  interface file at all. In the usual use case where the compiler is asked
  to generate the interface file as part of rebuilding the whole executable,
  this behavior has the advantage that the rebuild, which would fail anyway,
  fails sooner.

Changes to the Mercury implementation
-------------------------------------

* Grades that support trailing now always use trail segments; it is no longer
  possible to use a fixed size trail.

  One consequence of this is that the `trseg` grade component now acts
  as a synonym for the `tr` component. Since `tr` is shorter, `trseg`
  is deprecated in its favor.

  Another consequence is that the `--trail-size` and `--trail-size-kwords`
  runtime options no longer have any effect, and are deprecated.

* We have upgraded the bundled Boehm GC to v7.6.12 and libatomic_ops to v7.6.8.

NEWS for Mercury 20.01.2
========================

This is a bug-fix release.

* We have a fixed bug that prevented the runtime from building correctly
  in C grades on 32-bit platforms when *not* using GCC as the C compiler.

* [Mantis bug #461]. We have fixed an assertion failure affecting programs
  in low-level C parallel grades as they exit.

NEWS for Mercury 20.01.1
========================

This is a bug-fix release.

* We have added a new option `--warn-suspicious-recursion` that asks the
  compiler to warn about recursive calls which are likely to have problems,
  such as leading to infinite recursion. (This feature was present in the
  20.01 release but not announced.)

* We now allow combined higher-order types and insts as direct arguments of
  functors in discriminated unions, as in the following type:

        :- type job
            --->    job(pred(int::out, io::di, io::uo) is det).

  For any construction unification using this functor the argument must have
  the required higher-order inst; it is a mode error if it does not. When
  terms of type `job` with inst `ground` are deconstructed, the argument is
  inferred to have the given inst, allowing a higher-order call in that mode.
  (This feature was present in the 20.01 release but not announced.)

* [Mantis bug #496]. The compiler now emits a reminder about the limitation
  of common subexpression elimination in the presence of uniqueness when
  this is a possible cause of determinism errors.

  As of version 20.01, common subexpression elimination does not transform

         (
             X = f(A1, ..., An),
             goal A
         ;
             X = f(B1, ..., Bn),
             goal B
         )

  into

         X = f(X1, ..., Xn),
         (
             A1 = X1, ..., An = Xn,
             goal A
         ;
             B1 = X1, ..., Bn = Xn,
             goal B
         )

  when the insts of some of the arguments of `X` are at least partially unique.
  This is because the current mode analysis cannot track uniqueness through
  the extra unifications that this transformation introduces.

NEWS for Mercury 20.01
======================

Changes to the core libraries license
-------------------------------------

* We have modified the terms under which the Mercury core libraries are
  licensed by adding an exception to the requirements of clause 6 for
  executable files linked against the Mercury core libraries.

  See the file COPYING.LIB for the terms of the Mercury core library
  license.

  See the file LICENSE for licensing information in general.

  The licensing of the compiler and other parts of the system has **not**
  been changed.

Changes that may break compatibility
------------------------------------

* When the Mercury compiler looks at code using Mercury keywords (such as
  `"func"` and `"pred"`) and Mercury operators (such as the clause neck
  operator `":-"`) but which cannot be parsed as the Mercury constructs
  that those Mercury keywords and operators are part of, it now generates
  a specific error message for each discrepancy. In the past, when it found
  such code, the compiler considered such code to construct terms and/or
  to call functions and predicates. Usually, the terms did not belong to
  any declared type and the called functions and predicates did not exist,
  leading to confusing error messages from the compiler.

  The compiler's new approach generates considerably better diagnostics,
  but it does mean that code that uses Mercury's keywords and/or operators
  in ways that are inconsistent with Mercury's own uses of those keywords
  and operators will not compile anymore. Such code will need to be changed,
  typically by changing the names of some function symbols, functions
  or predicates.

* Code that switches on a field of a term could previously written directly as

        (
            Term ^ field = value1,
            ...
        ;
            Term ^ field = value2,
            ...
        )

    The compiler would then internally rearrange this as

        Field = Term ^ field,
        (
            Field = value1,
            ...
        ;
            Field = value2,
            ...
        )

    and then recognize this as a switch on `Field`.

    However, it turns out that while this transformation is valid
    in the vast majority of cases (well in excess of 99%), it is not valid
    in some rare circumstances involving terms with unique arguments.
    This means that the current version of the compiler is not allowed
    to do the above transformation automatically, so programmers must
    perform it themselves if needed.

* We have enabled stricter checking of non-ground final insts to reject more
  mode-incorrect code. Due to compiler limitations, some code that should be
  accepted will now be rejected. They will require modifications to appease
  the compiler. [Mantis bugs #86, #117, #191].

* We have enabled stricter checking of the requirement that a type, inst
  or a mode that is *not* exported from a module may not be used in the
  declarations of entities (such as predicates and typeclasses) that *is*
  exported from that module. This may require the explicit export of e.g.
  some types that previously were not exported.

* We have enabled stricter checking of type declarations and definitions:
  all declarations and definitions of a type must agree on whether the type
  is a solver type or not, and the definitions (as opposed to the names)
  of solver types may not be exported from their defining module.

* We have enabled stricter checking of module accessibility rules.
  If a module `m` has an `import_module` or `use_module` declaration for
  module `x.y.z`, it must also have `import_module` or `use_module`
  declarations for its ancestors `x` and `x.y`. And if the import or use
  of `x.y.z` is in module `m`'s interface, then the import or use of `x.y.z`'s
  ancestor modules must also be in the interface.

* The compiler now requires that, in projects that do not build
  a `Mercury.modules` file using e.g. `mmc -f *.m`, submodules must be stored
  in files whose name is the fully qualified module name followed by `.m`.
  (This means that e.g. a module named `a.b.c` must be in a file named
  `a.b.c.m`.) The reason for this change is that without it, the compiler
  cannot tell whether a file named e.g. `lexer.m` contains the Mercury
  standard library module `lexer`, or a submodule of a user-written
  parent module. [Mantis bug #489].

* The `:- module` declaration in a separate submodule now must contain the
  fully qualified module name.

* References to everything imported via `:- use_module` declarations
  must now be fully module qualified.

* `for` is now an operator. (See the extension of the syntax of inst
  declarations below.)

* It is now an error for a program to redefine a builtin type. The affected
  type names are:

        int
        int{8,16,32,64}
        uint
        uint{8,16,32,64}
        float
        character
        string
        {}
        =
        pred
        func
        pure
        semipure
        impure
        ''

* It is now an error for a program to redefine a builtin inst. The affected
  inst names are:

        =<
        any
        bound
        bound_unique
        clobbered
        clobbered_any
        free
        ground
        is
        mostly_clobbered
        mostly_unique
        mostly_unique_any
        not_reached
        unique
        unique_any

* It is now an error for a program to redefine a builtin mode. The affected
  mode names are:

        =
        >>
        any_func
        any_pred
        func
        is
        pred

* We have deleted the builtin inst synonyms `old` and `new`: their uses
  should be replaced with `any` and `free` respectively.

* We have deleted the builtin modes `no` and `oo`: their uses should be
  replaced with `oa` and `ia` respectively.

* The minimum version of the Java platform required by Mercury's Java
  backend is now Java SE 8.

* The representation of integer constants in the standard library's `term`
  and `lexer` modules has been generalised. The base, signedness and size of
  each integer constant is now recorded. Furthermore, these modules now use
  arbitrary-precision integers to represent the values of integer constants.

  Code that relies on the old representation of integer constants used by
  the `term` or `lexer` modules may use the `old_term_parser` library in the
  extras instead.

* We have changed the semantics of `int.(<<)` and `int.(>>)` so that they throw
  an exception if their second operand is not in [0, bits_per_int). For now,
  the old behaviour of these operations is provided by the functions
  `int.legacy_left_shift/2` and `int.legacy_right_shift/2`. These functions
  will be deleted in a future release.

* We have changed the semantics of `int.abs/1` so that it throws an exception
  if its argument is equal to `int.min_int`. The old behaviour of this function
  is provided by the new function `int.unchecked_abs/1`.

* We have changed the semantics of `array.map_corresponding_foldl/6` so that it
  throws an exception if the input arrays differ in size.

* We have changed the semantics of `array.shrink/3` and `array.resize/4`
  so that they throw an exception if their first argument is negative.

* We have changed the semantics of `array.fetch_items/4` so that it always
  throws an exception if its second or third argument is out of bounds.
  Previously, it would return an empty if list if its third argument was less
  than the second even if one, or both, of these arguments was out of bounds.

* We have removed the `io.poly_type` equivalence type from the `io` module.
  `string.poly_type` should be used directly. This may require an explicit
  import of the `string` module.

* The predicates and functions in the `term` module that provide conversion
  from arbitrary types to terms and vice versa have been moved to their own
  module, `term_conversion`. See the changes to the `term` module below for
  a list of affected predicates and functions.

* We have removed legacy support for the following systems:

    - IRIX
    - OSF/1

* The following compilation grades are no longer supported:

    - asm_jump*
    - jump*
    - hl_nest*
    - hlc_nest*
    - il*

Changes to the Mercury language
-------------------------------

* We have added nine new primitive types: `uint`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`,
  `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32` and `uint64`. The type `uint` is an
  unsigned integer type of the same size as Mercury's `int` type; the types
  `int8`, `int16`, `int32` and `int64` are signed integer types of width
  8, 16, 32 and 64 bits respectively; the types `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`
  and `uint64` are unsigned integer types of width 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits
  respectively.

    Literals of these new types must have a distinguishing suffix, for example:

        999u
        561i32
        0b1111100111i64
        0o16u8
        0x3e732i64

    Basic operations on the new primitive types are provided by the
    new standard library modules: `uint`, `int8`, `uint8`, `int16`, `uint16`,
    `int32`, `uint32` `int64`, and `uint64`.

* We have added a new kind of scope to the language: determinism checks
  for switch arms. These scopes are introduced by any of the new keywords

        require_switch_arms_det
        require_switch_arms_semidet
        require_switch_arms_multi
        require_switch_arms_nondet
        require_switch_arms_cc_multi
        require_switch_arms_cc_nondet
        require_switch_arms_erroneous
        require_switch_arms_failure

    `require_switch_arms_<determinism> [Var] Goal` tells the compiler
    to require `Goal` to be a switch on `Var` in which all the switch arms
    have determinisms at least as tight as `<determinism>`, and to generate
    error messages for any violations of this requirement.

* We have changed the meaning of `require_complete_switch` scopes slightly:
  the compiler now generates an error if the goal inside the scope
  is not a switch on the named variable.

* We have added a new kind of scope to the language for disabling warnings
  within the scope. A goal such as

        disable_warnings [singleton_vars] (
           Goal
        )

    is equivalent to `Goal`, with the exception that the compiler will not
    generate warnings about singleton variables inside `Goal`.

* We have extended the syntax of `:- inst` declarations to allow programmers
  to specify which type constructor's values the inst is meant for.
  The syntax consists of adding `for`, followed by the type constructor's
  name and arity, between the name of the inst and its definition, like this:

        :- inst listskel(Inst) for list/1
            --->    []
            ;       [Inst | listskel(Inst)].

  For the time being, this is useful only as a documentation of the
  programmer's intention; the compiler does not (yet) prevent the use of insts
  on values of types other than the one they were declared to be for.

* We have added an extension to include external files
  in `pragma foreign_decl` and `pragma foreign_code` declarations.

* We have added a foreign type assertion `word_aligned_pointer` that
  allows the Mercury implementation to avoid boxing values of the foreign type
  that the assertion is for when the type appears as the sole argument
  of a data constructor.

* We have added a new pragma named `consider_used`. This pragma tells
  the compiler to consider the predicate or function it names to be used,
  preventing it from generating unused procedure warnings either for
  any of its procedures, or for any of the procedures they call,
  directly or indirectly.

* We have added an optional second field to the `obsolete` pragma.
  When present, it may contain a list of the names and arities of
  predicates and/or functions that programmers should consider using
  instead of the obsolete predicate or function.

* We have added an `obsolete_proc` pragma. While the `obsolete` pragma
  declares all modes of a predicate or function to be obsolete, the
  `obsolete_proc` pragma declares only one mode of a predicate or function
  to be obsolete. Like the updated version of the `obsolete` pragma,
  the `obsolete_proc` pragma may have a second argument naming one or more
  suggested replacements.

* The Java backend now supports defining foreign types as primitive Java
  types.

* Digits in numeric literals may now be separated by underscores in order
  to improve readability.

Changes to the Mercury standard library
---------------------------------------

### New Integer Modules

* We have added the new modules `uint`, `int8`, `uint8`, `int16`, `uint16`,
  `int32`, `uint32`, `int64` and `uint64`. These modules provide
  the basic operations on the new integer types.

  Many other standard library modules now have additional predicates
  that support the new integer types; see the entries for those modules
  for details.

### New Random Number Generator Framework

* We have added a new type class based interface to random number generators
  to the `random` module. The new interface provides predicates for:

    - generating pseudo-random integers that are uniformly distributed
      in a range.
    - generating pseudo-random floats that are uniformly distributed
      in a range.
    - generating pseudo-random floats from a normal (i.e. Gaussian)
      distribution.
    - generating a random permutation of an array.
    - generating a random permutation of a list.

  Three new submodules, `random.sfc16`, `random.sfc32` and `random.sfc64`,
  provide instances of the new type classes. Further instances can be found
  in the extras distribution (see below).

### New Module: `diet`

* This module provides discrete interval encoding trees, which are a highly
  efficient set implementation for fat sets. This module is a contribution
  from Yes Logic Pty. Ltd.

### New Module: `edit_seq`

* This module provides operations for computing and manipulating edit
  sequences. Given two sequences of items, an edit sequence is the shortest
  sequence of edit operations (deletes, inserts and/or replaces) that will
  transform the first sequence into the second.

### New Module: `psqueue`

* This module implements a priority search queue ADT. This is a blend between
  a priority queue and a map. This was contributed by Matthias Güdemann.

### New Module: `ranges`

* This module represents sets of integers using sorted lists of ranges. This
  module exports operations that make it particularly suitable for representing
  domains in finite domain constraint solvers.

### New Module: `term_conversion`

* This module provides generic operations for the conversion of values of
  arbitrary types to and from terms. These operations were previously
  provided by the `term` module.

  See the list of changes to the `term` module below.

### New Module: `thread.barrier`

* This module provides the `barrier/0` type. This type can be used to control
  progress in concurrent code. This module was contributed by
  Mission Critical IT.

### New Module: `thread.future`

* This module provides the `future/0` and `future_io/0` types. These type can
  be used to compute values in parallel using other threads. This module was

* The `print_line` and `write_line` family of predicates behave like the
  `print` and `write` predicates, but also write a terminating newline.

* `print` now outputs arbitrary precision integers in their decimal form
   instead of printing their underlying representation.

* The predicate `set_environment_var/5` returns an `io.res` value rather than
  throwing an exception. The predicate `have_set_environment_var/0` can test
  whether the current platform supports the ability to set environment
  variables.

* We have made the following predicates exception safe: the current input or
  output stream is restored to the original stream if an exception is thrown
  during their execution:

     - `read/4`
     - `write_list/6`
     - `write_array/6`
     - `read_binary/4`
     - `write_binary/4`

    - `list_to_one_or_more/2`
    - `list_to_one_or_more_det/2`

* The following predicate has been deprecated and will be remove in a future
  release:

    - `takewhile/4` (use `take_while/4` instead)

* The `take/3` and `drop/3` predicates have been modified so that they fail if
  their first argument is less than zero.

* The `split_upto/4` and `take_upto/3` predicates and `take_upto/2` function
  have been modified so that they throw an exception if their first argument
  is negative.

    - `foldl5/12`
    - `foldr5/12`
    - `map_foldl4/11`

* We have added predicates that read from an explicitly specified input stream,
  not from the current input stream.

### Changes to the `pretty_printer` module

* The type `formatter_limit` has been renamed to `func_symbol_limit`, since
  this better reflects the type's purpose.

* We have replaced the `set_formatter` function with a predicate of the same
  name, since this allows the use of state variable notation when
  setting up more than one type-specific formatter,

* We have renamed the `write_doc_to_stream` predicate as `put_doc`, to better
  fit in with the names other predicates that operate on values of the
  `stream.writer` typeclass, and changed its interface to group
  the prettyprinter parameters together in a value of the type
  that was designed for this purpose.

### Changes to the `random` module.

    Similar changes have been made to the other set implementations
    in the library.

  backslash escapes when required.

* [Mantis bug #348]. Float special values, NaNs and Infinities, are now
  converted to strings in a way that is backend- and grade-independent.

* [Mantis bug #376]. `base_digit_to_int/3` and `det_base_digit_to_int/2` now
  check for overflow and underflow in all bases, not only base 10.

Changes to the Mercury compiler
-------------------------------

### New warning options

* `--inform-incomplete-switch`, `--inform-incomplete-switch-threshold N`

   This option asks the compiler to generate an informational message for
   switches that do not cover all of the function symbols that the switched-on
   variable could be bound to.

   The option `--inform-incomplete-switch-threshold N` can be used to restrict
   the generation of these messages to only switches that *do* cover at least
   *N* percent of the function symbols that the switched-on variable
   could be bound to.

* `--inhibit-style-warnings`

  This option asks the compiler not to generate any warnings that are purely
  about programming style, and do not point out code that is reasonably
  likely to be wrong.

* `--no-warn-accumulator-swaps`

  We have renamed the `--inhibit-accumulator-warnings` option to
  `--no-warn-accumulator-swaps`.

* `--warn-dead-preds`

  While the existing option `--warn-dead-procs` asks the compiler to generate
  warnings for every unused procedure of the module being compiled, this new
  option asks the compiler to generate a warning for a predicate or function
  only if none of its procedures is used.

* `--warn-implicit-stream-calls`

  This option asks the compiler to generate a warning for every call to a
  predicate `p/N` if there is also a predicate `p/(N+1)` which differs from
  `p/N` only in that it has additional argument at the front of its argument
  list that specifies an I/O stream. This is intended to generate warnings for
  calls to predicates such as `io.write_string/3`, which writes to the current
  output stream, to encourage programmers to call `io.write_string/4` instead.
  If the option is given, the compiler will also generate warnings for calls
  to predicates such as `io.see`, `io.seen`, `io.tell` and `io.told`, which
  set the current input or output streams respectively.

* `--warn-inconsistent-pred-order-clauses`, `--warn-inconsistent-pred-order-foreign-procs`

  Both of these options ask the compiler to generate a warning if, among
  either (a) the set of exported predicates and functions of the module,
  or (b) the set of nonexported predicates and functions of the module,
  the order of their definitions does not match the order of their
  declarations. The first option applies only to predicates and functions
  defined by Mercury clauses; the second applies to predicates and functions
  defined by either Mercury clauses or foreign procedures.

  The option `--warn-inconsistent-pred-order` is a shorter synonym for
  `--warn-inconsistent-pred-order-clauses`.

* `--warn-insts-with-functors-without-type`

  This option asks the compiler to generate a warning for inst definitions
  that specify functors but do not specify what type they are for.

* `--warn-interface-imports-in-parents`

  This option asks the compiler to generate a warning for modules that are
  imported in the interface of a parent module, but not used in the interface
  of that module.

* `--warn-non-contiguous-decls`

  This option asks the compiler to generate a warning if the mode
  declaration(s) of a predicate or function does not immediately follow its
  `:- pred` or `:- func` declaration. This is option is turned on by default.

* `--warn-suspected-occurs-check-failure`

  We have significantly improved the compiler's ability to detect, and
  to generate warnings about, code that violates the occurs check. This
  option is turned on by default.

* `--warn-suspicious-foreign-code`

  This option asks the compiler to warn about possible errors in the bodies of
  `foreign_code` pragmas.

### New verbosity options

* `--limit-error-contexts`

  This option asks the compiler the restrict the errors and warnings it prints
  to those originating from a named file or files and/or specified ranges of
  line numbers.

### New link options

* `--no-default-runtime-library-directory`

  This new option prevents the compiler from adding any directories to the
  runtime search path automatically.

### New output options

* `--output-class-dir`, `--output-class-directory`

   This option causes the compiler to print the name of the directory in
   which generated Java class files will be placed.

* `--output-csharp-compiler`

  This option causes the compiler to print the command used to invoke
  the C# compiler.

* `--output-target-arch`

  This option causes the compiler to print the target architecture.

### New auxiliary output options

* `--show-definitions`

  This option causes the compiler to write out a list of the types, insts,
  modes, predicates, functions, typeclasses and instances defined in a module
  to a file named `<module>.defns`.

* `--show-definition-line-counts`

  This option causes the compiler to write out a list of predicates and
  functions defined in a module, together with the names of the files
  containing them and their approximate line counts, to a file named
  `<module>.defn_line_counts`.

### Changes to output options

* `--generate-module-order`, `--imports-graph`

  These options no longer imply `--generate-dependencies`.

### Changes to link options

* `--mercury-linkage`

  The compiler no longer sets the runtime search path when
  the value of `--mercury-linkage` is `static`.

### Changes to optimizations

* We have extended tail call optimization from self recursive calls only
  to mutually recursive calls as well, when generating high level C code,
  C# code, or Java code. (The compiler has long been able apply tail call
  optimization to mutually recursive calls when generating low level C code.)

* We have disabled intermodule optimisation of any predicates or functions
  using `try` goals. This fixes a serious issue as `try` goals are not
  properly written to `.opt` files, so when read back would not actually
  catch any exceptions.

### Bug fixes

* We have fixed some bugs with constrained polymorphic modes.

* The compiler now reports an error for binary/octal/hexadecimal integer
  literals that cannot be represented in the compiler's native `int` type.

* [Mantis bug #3]. We have fixed a long-standing bug causing crashes in
  deep profiling grades, related to unify/compare for tuples.

* [Mantis bug #184]. We have fixed a bug that caused a compiler abort in the
  presence of unsatisfied type class constraints.

* [Mantis bug #196]. We have made binary compatibility checks in C grades
  work again; GCC and clang were optimizing them away.

* [Mantis bug #264]. Putting a function with a non-default signature into a
  ground term is now no longer allowed. This is because extracting the function
  from the term would assume the default function signature.

* [Mantis bug #278]. We have fixed a bug where erroneous state variable use
  in the head of a lambda expression would cause a compiler abort instead of
  generating an error message.

* [Mantis bug #318]. We no longer erroneously report an error if a
  `foreign_type` pragma precedes the `:- type` declaration to which it applies.

* [Mantis bug #388]. We have fixed a bug where JAR files were being installed
  with incorrect permissions.

* [Mantis bug #391]. We have fixed a bug where the conditions on `trace` goals
  were being discarded when inlined across module boundaries.

* [Mantis bug #402]. The current state of a state variable can now be used in
  the head of a `require_complete_switch` scope.

* [Mantis bug #415]. We have fixed a bug that caused the compiler to go into
  an infinite loop when pretty printing recursive insts for use in error
  messages.

* [Mantis bug #420]. We have fixed a bug where `try` goals that were inlined
  across module boundaries would ignore exceptions instead of catching them.

* [Mantis bug #436]. We have fixed a bug where the compiler would silently
  allow a `foreign_enum` pragma to contain a constructor not belonging to the
  type that is the subject of the pragma.

* [Mantis bug #437]. We have fixed a bug that caused the compiler to abort if
  an empty submodule was encountered.

### Other changes

* The C# back-end now bootstraps.

* The Java back-end now bootstraps.

* The old IL back-end has been deleted.

* The Erlang backend is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

* Class files generated for executables in the Java grade are now automatically
  packaged up into Java archives (JARs).

* We have upgraded the bundled Boehm GC to v7.6.10 and libatomic_ops to v7.6.2.

Portability improvements
------------------------

* The `asm_fast*` and `reg*` grades now work on 64-bit Intel OS X systems when
  using GCC as the C compiler.

  See README.MacOS for further details.

* We have improved support for FreeBSD, specifically:

    - Allowing architectures other than `i*86`.
    - Allowing the use of shared libraries.
    - Enabling support for threads.
    - Enabling parallel job support with `mmc --make`.

  See README.FreeBSD for further details.

* We have added support for OpenBSD.

  See README.OpenBSD for further details.

* We have added support for Linux systems using musl libc.

* We have improved support for AIX.

  See README.AIX for further details.

* The NetBSD `editline` library may now be used in place of GNU `readline` to
  provide line editing capabilities in the debugger.

* [Mantis bug #357]. We now use the `libdispatch` implementation of semaphores
  on OS X as the POSIX one was a non-functional stub.

* [Mantis bug #463]. We now support the use of the Microsoft C# compiler
  (i.e. Roslyn) in POSIX environments.

Changes to the Mercury debugger
-------------------------------

* Interactive queries are now supported on OS X.

* The `break` command can now auto-complete on the filename:linenumber pairs
  of events, provided the Mercury system can access the readline library.

* Interactive queries have been improved:

    - Queries can use variable bindings from the current environment.
    - Exceptions thrown from queries are properly handled.
    - Non-canonical output bindings are now printed in solutions.
    - Underscore variables are no longer printed in solutions.

* We have added a `browse --web` command to view terms in a web browser.

Editor support
--------------

* The vim syntax highlighting files have been significantly improved
  thanks to Sebastian Godelet.

Changes to the extras distribution
----------------------------------

* We have added support for Unicode and other enhancements to the `lex` and
  `regex` libraries. Thanks to Sebastian Godelet.

* We have added some additional random number generator implementations for
  use with the new random number generator framework.

Known issues
------------

* [Mantis bug #466]. The experimental support for dependent parallel
  conjunctions in low-level C grades is known to sometimes cause aborts
  in the code generator.

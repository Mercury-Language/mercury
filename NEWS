NEWS for Mercury release 0.7.2
------------------------------

We have split the distribution into two parts, a `core' part and an
`extras' part.  We still recommend that people get both parts.


Changes to the Mercury language:
********************************

* We have added support for constraint handling.

  To support constraint handling, we've made the mode system a bit
  more flexible.  There is a new inst `any' for variables whose value
  is unknown but which may have constraints on them. 

  The support for `any' insts is not 100% complete; in particular, we
  do not support passing values of inst `free' where values of inst
  `any' are expected, so sometimes you have to explicitly call a predicate
  to initialize a free variable to inst `any'.  Also the Mercury language
  reference manual does not yet contain any documentation on `any' insts.

  The `extras' distribution includes packages for doing constraint
  solving on (a) floating point numbers and (b) terms containing
  Prolog-style variables.  See below.

* The C interface now includes generalized trailing support.

  The compiler has a new set of grades `*.tr' (e.g. `asm_fast.gc.tr')
  which provide support for trailing.  They could be used by predicates or
  functions defined using the C interface to perform such things as
  constraint solving, backtrackable destructive update, or even automatic
  unwinding of database transactions on backtracking.  See the
  documentation in the "Trailing" section of the Mercury language
  reference manual (it's at the end of the "C interface" section,
  which is in the chapter on "Pragmas").

* It is now possible to stop the compiler from optimizing "impure"
  Mercury code inappropriately.

  This is accomplished by declaring impure predicates to be impure,
  allowing the compiler to treat them cautiously.  The compiler tracks
  impurity, and requires all impure predicates, and calls to them, to
  be declared.  For more information, see "Impurity" section of the
  "Pragmas" chapter of the Mercury Language Reference Manual.

* We now support user-defined equality predicates.

  See the Mercury Language Reference Manual for details.

  However, until we have support for type classes (coming soon :-),
  you will probably run into trouble if you try to use compare/3,
  write/1, functor/2, etc., on a type with user-defined equality.
  Hence we recommend that this feature should not yet be used.
  Because of this, we haven't bothered to document the
  rationale or use for user-defined equality predicates
  (though rest assured that when we do have type classes,
  this feature will indeed be useful).

* We have introduced new syntax to allow higher-order predicate expressions
  to use DCG notation.

  For details, see the "Data-terms" section of the "Syntax" chapter
  and/or the "Creating higher-order terms" section of the "Higher-order"
  chapter in the Mercury Language Reference Manual.


Changes to the Mercury standard library:
****************************************

* We have rewritten the `store' module to use unique modes.

  The `store' module provides a declarative interface to mutable variables
  with destructive update.

* The library predicate unsorted_aggregate/4 in std_util.m
  now interleaves calls of the aggregation predicate with
  the generation of solutions, rather than first finding all
  solutions and then aggregating them.  This allows you
  to print out solutions as they are found, for example.

* We have added a few new predicates, namely list__takewhile/4,
  bag__to_list/2, and varset__new_named_var/4.

* We have changed the interface to lexer__get_token_list to use a more
  efficient representation of lists of tokens. The functionality is
  unchanged.

* We have fixed a problem where io__call_system/4 was not returning the
  the exit code of the invoked command on some operating systems.

* We have fixed a bug in relation__rtc/4.

* We have added the predicate queue__delete_all/3.

* Map (and tree234) have 2 new predicates: map__foldl which is
  analogous to list__foldl, and map__map_values which is analogous
  to list__map.

* We have added integer.m, which implements arbitrary precision integers,
  and rational.m, which implements arbitrary precision rational numbers.


New library packages in the `extras' distribution:
**************************************************

* We have added a CLP(R) interface.

  The new library package `cfloat_lib', in the extras/clpr directory,
  is a Mercury interface to the CLP(R) constraint solver.  The module
  `cfloat' defines a type `cfloat' for constrained floating point numbers,
  together with the usual arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, <, >, =<, >=)
  as well as some non-linear constraint functions (abs, min, max,
  sin, cos, arcsin, and arccos).  The module `dump' provides I/O predicates
  for printing out constraints.

  Note that since `cfloat' is a different type than `float', you
  have to use the `==' operator provided in this package rather
  than `=' if you want to unify a cfloat with a float.
  
  We don't yet support any equivalent to SICStus Prolog's
  call_residue/3 or the three-argument version of CLP(R)'s dump predicate.

  But apart from that, it all works nicely.  And even though we support
  equivalents to such nasty non-logical meta-programming constructs
  as CLPR's `dump' primitive, we still manage to preserve referential
  transparency -- the interface provided is a completely pure declarative
  interface.

* We have added some support for Prolog-style variables and coroutining.

  The module extras/trailed_updated/var.m provides a type `var(T)'
  which is a Prolog-style variable that holds a value of type T.
  These variables can have the new inst `any' described above.
  There's also an implementation of freeze/2, for coroutining
  (dynamic scheduling).  The extras/trailed_update/samples subdirectory
  has an example of the use of freeze/2 to solve the N-queens problem.

* We have added library modules for backtrackable destructive update.

  See the new modules `tr_array' and `tr_store' in the extras/trailed_update.
  These are versions of `array' and `store' that use trailed backtrackable
  destructive update.  The extras/trailed_update/samples subdirectory
  has an example of the use of tr_store to provide a reasonably efficient
  meta-interpreter.

* We have added an interface to ODBC databases in extras/odbc. 

  Thanks to the people from Mission Critical, in particular Renaud Paquay,
  for providing the original version. 


Changes to the Mercury compiler:
********************************

* We have added support for termination analysis.

  For details, see the "Termination analysis" subsection of the
  "Implementation-dependent pragmas" section of the "Pragmas" chapter
  of the Mercury Language Reference Manual.

  This implementation is experimental, but our tests show that it is
  capable of proving the termination of most predicates and functions
  in real programs.

  The current implementation of termination analysis depends on the
  third-party package lp_solve. This is package is available from
  <ftp://ftp.es.ele.tue.nl/pub/lpsolve>; it is also included in the
  lp_solve subdirectory of the Mercury source distribution. Note
  that the copyright of lp_solve includes substantial restrictions.

  Details of the analysis is available in "Termination Analysis for
  Mercury" by Chris Speirs, Zoltan Somogyi and Harald Sondergaard. In P.
  Van Hentenryck, editor, "Static Analysis: Proceedings of the Fourth
  International Symposium", Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Springer,
  1997.  A longer version is available for download from
  <http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/publications/tr_db/mu_97_09.ps.gz>.

* We have made it easier to use different compilation models ("grades").

  The Mercury compiler (mmc), the Mercury front-end to GNU C (mgnuc),
  and the Mercury linker (ml) now figure out which grade to use based
  on the options specified.  This means that for example to enable
  profiling, you can just compile and link with `--profiling', rather
  than having to specify grade `asm_fast.gc.prof'.

  Attempts to mix object files compiled with different grades should now
  result in errors at link time rather than undefined behaviour.

* We have improved the C interface.

  We now handle the case when `main' is defined in C rather than in Mercury
  slightly more cleanly -- there are functions mercury_init()
  and mercury_terminate() for initializing and terminating the
  Mercury runtime.  See runtime/init.h for documentation of the functions,
  and see samples/c_interface/simpler_c_calls_mercury for an example of
  their use.

* The compiler does a better job of constant-propagation optimization.

* We have fixed a few minor bugs.


NEWS for Mercury release 0.7.3
------------------------------

This release is primarily a bug-fix release.  The problems fixed
include installation problems on Windows, some problems with the
profiler, and compatibility with GNU Make versions >= 3.76.
But as well as bug fixes, there are a few minor improvements:

* The profiler now allows you to merge profiling data from multiple runs.

  There's a new script `mprof_merge_runs' to support this.
  See the "Profiling" section of the Mercury User's Guide,
  or the man page for `mprof_merge_runs'.

* Termination analysis no longer uses the `lp_solve' package,
  so we have removed it from the distribution.
  
  This avoids some portability problems and some copyright issues
  (the `lp_solve' package had a quite restrictive license).

* We've fixed one of the limitations: unique mode declarations
  no longer have to precede non-unique mode declarations.


NEWS since release 0.7.3:
-------------------------

Changes to the Mercury language:
********************************

* The type system now includes support for Haskell-style type classes.

  Type classes let you specify an interface and then provide multiple
  different implementations of that interface.  They're similar to
  abstract base classes in C++ or "interfaces" in Java.
  See the "Type classes" chapter of the Mercury Language Reference Manual
  for details.

  Unlike Haskell 1.4, Mercury supports multi-parameter type classes,
  but we do not (yet) support constructor classes, and nor do we
  support default methods.

* Mode inference can now infer "mostly-unique" modes as well as
  "unique" modes.

* You can now declare both committed-choice ("cc") and backtracking (non-cc)
  modes for the same predicate.
  
  Determinism analysis will pick the appropriate one to use for each
  call based on the context.

* The module system now includes support for sub-modules.

  The aim of this extension is twofold.  One aim is to provide more
  fine-grained encapsulation control: nested sub-modules within a
  single source file provide a convenient method for encapsulating
  units smaller than a source file.  The other aim is to provide better
  support for structuring large software packages that consist of many
  source files.  Sub-modules can be defined in separate files, with
  separate compilation, which means that you can also use this feature
  to combine a group of existing Mercury modules into a single logical
  package, with proper namespace control and encapsulation.

  See the "Modules" chapter of the Mercury language reference manual
  for details.

* We have made more improvements to the C interface.

  The C interface now includes support for defining procedures
  that can have multiple solutions (i.e. those whose determinism
  is `nondet' or `multi') in C.

  Also there's a new declaration, `pragma import', which is a bit
  like the existing `pragma c_code' declaration except that
  instead of giving a C code fragment, you just give the name
  of a C function.  `pragma import' is like the inverse of the
  existing `pragma export' declaration.

  XXX These features are not yet documented.
  XXX (See tests/hard_coded/pragma_import.m for some examples.)

* We have added support for automatic tabling (memoization).

  See the "Tabled evaluation" subsection of the "Implementation-dependent
  pragmas" section of the "Pragmas" chapter of the Mercury language
  reference manual.

* We have added (tentative) support for exception handling.

  The interface to exception handling is actually via an `exception.m'
  library module rather than a new language construct.  
  For now, this module is located in the `extras/exceptions'
  directory, which is part of the `mercury-extras' distribution,
  but our intent is to eventually migrate this into the Mercury
  standard library if experience with its use proves positive.

  The exception handling interface uses committed choice nondeterminism
  to avoid some semantic problems with previous exception handling
  proposals.

  See the documentation in the interface of `exception.m' for details.

Changes to the Mercury standard library:
****************************************

* The getopt module now supports a new type of option data, namely
  `maybe_int(maybe(int))', to allow optional arguments with integer values.
  There is also a new corresponding lookup predicate,
  getopt__lookup_maybe_int_option/3. 

  See the "getopt" chapter of the Mercury Library Reference Manual for details.

* Support for memory profiling: new predicates report_full_memory_stats/0
  in benchmarking.m and io__report_full_memory_stats/2 in io.m.

  See the "benchmarking" chapter of the Mercury Library Reference Manual
  for details.

* Miscellaneous new predicates.

  The Mercury standard library now includes the following new predicates:
  bag__least_upper_bound/3, bag__remove_list/3, bag__det_remove_list/3,
  det_univ_to_type/2, list__take_upto/3, set__count/2, set_ordlist__count/2,
  store__new_cyclic_mutvar/4, relation__add_values/4,
  relation__from_assoc_list/2, relation__compose/3, varset__select/3
  and eqvclass__same_eqvclass_list/2.

  Also the old relation__to_assoc_list/2 predicate has been renamed as
  relation__to_key_assoc_list/2; there is a new relation__to_assoc_list/2
  predicate with a different type for the second argument.

  See the Mercury Library Reference Manual for details.

* A few library procedures that have implicit side effects and are thus 
  intended for debugging use only have been declared `impure'.
  You will need to write `impure' before every call to these procedures
  and typically you will need to add a `pragma promise_pure' declaration
  for the callers.

  The predicates affected are report_stats/0 and report_full_memory_stats/0
  in library/benchmarking.m; unsafe_dump/2, unsafe_dump_float/1, and
  unsafe_dump_tableaus/0 in extras/clpr/dump.m; and debug_freeze/3
  and debug_freeze/4 in extras/trailed_update/var.m.


Changes to the Mercury implementation:
**************************************

* We've added a new source-to-source transformation - deforestation.

  Deforestation transforms conjunctions to avoid the construction
  of intermediate data structures and to avoid multiple traversals
  over data structures. Deforestation is enabled at optimization level
  `-O3' or higher, or by using the `--deforestation' option.

* We've added support for "transitive" inter-module analysis.

  With the previous support for inter-module optimization, when
  analysing a module, the compiler could make use of information
  about the modules that it imports directly, but not about
  modules that are imported indirectly.  "Transitive" inter-module
  analysis gives the compiler information about indirectly
  imported modules.

  However, currently this is only used for termination analysis;
  optimizations such as inlining still use only ordinary inter-module
  analysis, not transitive inter-module analysis.

* Array bounds checking can now be disabled.

  To disable array bounds checking, you must compile with
  `--intermodule-optimization' enabled and you must also
  define the C macro ML_OMIT_ARRAY_BOUNDS_CHECKS (e.g. by using
  `MGNUCFLAGS=-DML_OMIT_ARRAY_BOUNDS_CHECKS' in your Mmake file). 
  [XXX we also need to fix problems with intermodule inlining heuristics.]

* We've added some primitive debugging support.

  The runtime system now includes a rudimentary "four-port" style debugger
  (actually with eight ports).
  To use this debugger, you need to build your program with debugging
  enabled, which is normally done using the `--debug' (or `-g') option,
  and then run it using the `mdb' command, e.g. `mdb a.out'.
  Type `h' at the `mtrace>' prompt for a list of the available commands.

  XXX We should document this in the Mercury User's Guide.

* The support for debugging using Prolog now includes support for
  detailed control over how terms are printed out during debugging.

  See the "Using Prolog" section of the Mercury User's Guide for details.

* The Mercury profiler has a number of new features.

  The profiler now supports profiling just user time, or profiling
  real (elapsed) time, rather than profiling user + system time.
  We've also added support for memory profiling.

  See the "Profiling" chapter of the Mercury User's Guide for details.

* Profiling should now work on MS Windows.

  To enable profiling on MS Windows, you need to have Sergey
  Okhapkin's latest version of gnu-win32 that includes his patch to add
  support for setitimer().  Sergey's "CoolView" version of cygwin.dll
  is available via <http://miracle.geol.msu.ru/sos/>; his patch will
  probably also be included in the next (b19) release of gnu-win32.
  Note that on Windows, you must use the Mercury runtime system's `-Tr'
  (profile real time) option; profiling just user time or user + system
  time is still not supported on Windows, because to the best of our
  knowledge Windows doesn't provide the necessary system calls.

* Intermediate files can be placed in subdirectories.

  If you use the `--use-subdirs' option to `mmake' or `mmc',
  then they will create the various intermediate files used
  by the Mercury implementation in a subdirectory called `Mercury'
  rather than in the current directory.  (For `mmake', if there
  is already a `Mercury' subdirectory, then this option is the default.)
  This keeps your source directories much less cluttered.

* Mmake has a new variable GRADEFLAGS for specifying options that
  affect the grade (compilation model).

  This means that for example to enable profiling, you can build with
  `GRADEFLAGS = --profiling' in your Mmakefile, rather than having to
  use the more obscure incantation `GRADE = asm_fast.gc.prof'.

* The components of the GRADE mmake variable/the argument to the --grade
  option may now be given in any order. The compiler also has a new option
  `--output-grade-string' which prints the cannonical grade string for
  the set of options with which the compiler was invoked.

* We've made a few small improvements to the efficiency of the generated code.

* The system has been ported to Linux/PPC.

* We've updated to version 4.12 of the Boehm garbage collector.

* Numerous bug fixes.

* XXX remove the X debugger command

NEWS since Mercury 13.05.x
--------------------------

Changes to the Mercury language:

* Repeated type variables may now occur in the heads of type class instances.
  For example, instance declarations like the following are now allowed:

      :- instance foo(list(T), map(T, T)).

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have added the function cord.condense/1.

* We have added the following predicates to the array and version_array
  modules: is_empty/1, all_true/2 and all_false/2.

* We have added the following functions to the map module: det_min_key/1
  and det_max_key/1.

* We have added the following predicates to the list module: foldr2/6 and
  foldr3/8.

* We have added the following predicates to the bag module: foldl/4 and
  foldl2/6.

* We have added the following predicate to the assoc_list module:
  foldl2_values/6.

* We have added the following predicates to the pqueue module:
  is_empty/1, peek/3, peek_key/2, peek_value/2, det_peek/3 and merge/3.
  We have also added the following fuctions to the pqueue module:
  det_peek_key/1 and det_peek_value/1.


NEWS for Mercury 13.05.2
------------------------

This is a bug-fix release.

* The following functions in the standard library's cord module now use
  constant stack space: list/1, rev_list/1, cord_list_to_cord/1 and
  cord_list_to_list/1.
* Linker options set via the LDFLAGS and EXTRA_LDFLAGS mmake variables
  are now applied to all executables in the Mercury system.  Likewise, 
  for shared libraries and the LD_LIBFLAGS and EXTRA_LD_LIBFLAGS mmake
  variables.  (Bug #288)
* We have added a workaround for a problem that was preventing the
  asm_fast grades working with GCC 4.8.  (Bug #293)
* Fix inst for constant type_infos.  (Bug #297)
* Fix compiler abort during liveness detection.  (Bug #51)
* We have fixed a bug that could crash the compiler when enabling the last
  call modulo constructor optimisation on the Java and (probably) C#
  grades.  (Bug #300)

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* Semantic equality predicates are now defined for 2-3-4 trees and maps.

NEWS for Mercury 13.05.1
------------------------

This is a bug-fix release.

* Various build problems on Solaris and NetBSD have been fixed.
* The C# compiler for use by the csharp grade can now be specified using
  a new option to the configure script, `--with-csharp-compiler'.  This
  fixes a problem where it was not possible to build the Mercury libraries
  in the csharp grade against version 4.0 of the .NET framework using
  Mono.  (See README.CSharp for further details.)
* In C grades, closing a file stream multiple times no longer causes a
  segmentation fault.  (Bug #161)
* `--warn-dead-procs' no longer emits warnings for procedures if they are
  foreign exported to any language.  Previously, warnings were incorrectly
  emitted if there were only foreign_export pragmas for foreign languages
  unsupported by the current backend.  (Bug #183)
* The compiler now emits a warning if the variable that is the subject of
  of a require_complete_switch scope does not appear in the scoped goal.
  (Bug #257)
* A bug that caused a compiler abort in the low-level C backend has been
  fixed.

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have added the function bimap.count/1.

* An equality predicate is now defined for version_hash_tables.


NEWS for Mercury 13.05
----------------------

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have swapped the argument order of the predicates set.singleton_set/2,
  set_bbbtree.singleton_set/2, set_ordlist.singleton_set/2 and
  set_unordlist.singleton_set/2 so that it conforms with the order in the
  other set modules.

* All the modules that operate on sets now have two new predicates.
  One is insert_new: if the item is not already in the set, it inserts
  the item, otherwise it fails. The other is all_true: it succeeds if
  and only if all elements in the set pass a test.

* The map and varset modules each have a new predicate that deletes
  a sorted list of items from a map or varset, and can do so faster than
  usual by exploiting the order.

* The map, bimap and tree234 modules each have a new predicate that does
  a search, and if the search is unsuccessful, does an insertion during
  the *same* traversal.

* The argument order of the following predicates has been changed so as to
  make them more conducive to the use of state variable notation:
  pqueue.insert/4, pqueue.remove/4, stack.push/3, stack.push_list/3,
  stack.pop/3 and stack.det_pop/3.

* We have added versions of the operations in the math module that omit the
  domain checks.

* We have added new predicates to the parsing_utils module:
  input_string/3, get_skip_whitespace_pred/2 and next_char_no_progress/4.

* The lexer module returns base 10 integer literals in the string
  representation, if the integer is too large for an `int'.

* We have add the following new predicates to the list module:
  list.all_true_corresponding/3, list.all_false_corresponding/3 and
  list.same_length3/3.

* We have added the type maybe.maybe_error/2 which is polymorphic in the
  error type.

* We have added predicates to the calendar module for folding over the days
  in a given range of dates: foldl_days/5, foldl2_days/7 and foldl3_days/9.

* We have added two functions to both the hash_table and version_hash_table
  modules: copy/1 and from_assoc_list/4.

Changes to the Mercury compiler:

* Generation of 64-bit code on Windows using the MinGW64 port of GCC
  is now supported, i.e. the x86_64-w64-mingw32 architecture is now
  supported.

* We have improved compilation times for very large programs.  In
  particular, compilation times for predicates containing the following
  have been improved:
      - large ground terms
      - large disjunctions
      - large numbers of higher order constructs and/or code that uses
        large hierarchies of type classes

* We have implemented a type representation optimisation, where a functor
  with exactly one argument can be represented by a tagged pointer to the
  argument value, which itself does not require the tag bits.

* In C grades, consecutive enumeration arguments in discriminated
  union types can now be packed into a single word.

* Double-precision `float' constructor arguments are now stored in
  unboxed form in high-level C grades.

* Double-precision `float' constructor arguments are now stored in
  unboxed form on 32-bit architectures in the low-level C grades.
  This was previously so for 64-bit architectures.

* Double-precision float arguments can now be passed via dedicated Mercury
  abstract machine registers to avoid boxing, in low-level C grades on
  32-bit architectures. Float variables can occupy two words on the
  Mercury stack to avoid boxing.

* The option `--warn-non-tail-recursion' no longer requires
  `--high-level-code'.

* A new option, `--sign-assembly', provides supports for signing
  assemblies generated by the C# backend with a strong name.

* A new option, `--cstack-reserve-size', allows the size of the C
  stack for executables to be changed on Microsoft Windows systems.

Changes to the Mercury debugger:

* We have added new capabilities to the "level", "retry" and "finish" mdb
  commands. If these commands are given the argument "clentry", they will
  operate on the ancestor of the current call that represents entry to the
  clique of mutually recursive procedures that the current call belongs to.
  If they are given the argument "clparent", they will operate on the parent
  of that call.

* The mdb command "stack" can now find and mark cliques of mutually recursive
  calls on the stack, and can (and by default, will) impose a limit on the
  number of lines it prints for each clique.

Changes to the extras distribution:

* We have added a binding to the GLFW library.

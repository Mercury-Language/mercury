NEWS since Mercury 11.01
------------------------

HIGHLIGHTS
==========

Changes to the Mercury language:

* The `char' type now represents a Unicode code point.

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have improved Unicode support in the standard library.

* We have changed the argument order of many of the predicates in the array,
  bag, bimap, eqvclass, map, multi_map, queue and set modules in order
  to make them more conducive to the use of state variable notation.

    + Procedures in the string module now understand either UTF-8 or
      UTF-16 encodings, depending upon the backend.

    + Text I/O routines now read and write files in UTF-8 encoding.

* We have added additional modes for set.map/3 and set.map_fold/5.

* We have add the following new functions for creating singleton
  maps: bimap.singleton/2, injection.singleton/2, map.singleton/2,
  rbtree.singleton/2 and tree234.singleton/2 .

* The following procedures have been added to the standard library:

	array2d.init/3
	bitmap.init/2
        cord.init/0
	hash_table.init/3
	hash_table.init_default/1
	store.init/1
	semaphore.init/1
	semaphore.init/3
	version_array.init/2
	version_array2d.init/3
	version_bitmap.init/2
	version_hash_table.init/3
	version_hash_table.unsafe_init/3
	version_hash_table.init_default/1
	version_hash_table.unsafe_init_default/1
	version_store.init/0

   They replace the following procedures, which are now obsolete and will be
   removed in a later release:

	array2d.new/3
	bitmap.new/2
	hash_table.new/3
	hash_table.new_default/1
	store.new/1
	semaphore.new/1
	semaphore.new/3
	version_array.new/2
	version_array2d.new/3
	version_bitmap.new/2
	version_hash_table.new/3
	version_hash_table.unsafe_new/3
	version_hash_table.new_default/1
	version_hash_table.unsafe_new_default/1
	version_store.new/0

* The following procedures are have been deprecated and will be removed in
  a future release: dir.basename_det/1, list.replace_nth_det/3,
  list.replace_nth_det/4, list.index0_det/2, list.index1_det/2,
  list.index0_det/2, list.index1_det/2, list.last_det/1, stack.top_det/1,
  stack.pop_det/3, string.remove_suffix_det/2, string.index_det/2,
  string.index_det/3, string.set_char_det/3, string.set_char_det/4 and
  type_desc.ground_pseudo_type_desc_type_to_type_desc_det/1.

  The versions of these procedures that use "det_" as a prefix should be
  used instead.  (We have added these where they did not already exist.) 

* The deprecated modules graph, group and relation are no longer included
  in the library.

* The following predicates have been added to the modules that provide sets
  in the library: set.is_empty/1, set_bbbtree.is_empty/1,
  set_ctree234.is_empty/1, set_ordlist.is_empty/1, set_tree234.is_empty/1,
  set_unordlist.is_empty/1, sparse_bitset.is_empty/1, tree_bitset.is_empty/1,
  set.filter/4, set_bbbtree.filter/3, set_bbbtree.filter/4, set_ctree.filter/3,
  set_ctree.filter/4, set_ordlist.filter/3, set_ordlist.filter/4,
  set_tree.filter/3, set_tree.filter/4, set_unordlist.filter/3,
  set_unordlist.filter/4, sparse_bitset.filter/3, sparse_bitset.filter/4,
  tree_bitset.filter/3, tree_bitset.filter/4.

  All the is_empty predicates are synonyms for the existing empty/1 predicates
  in those modules.

* We have added the predicate pqueue.det_remove/4.  It is like pqueue.remove/4
  except that it throws an exception instead of failing if the priority queue
  is empty.

* The new modules svlist, svstack and svpqueue provide state variable friendly
  versions of predicates in the list, stack and pqueue modules.
  (As with the other sv* modules these modules are intended to pave the
  way for an eventual change of the predicate argument ordering in the
  list, stack and pqueue modules.)

* We have added additional modes with unique and mostly-unique accumulators
  to rbtree.foldl/4, rbtree.foldl2/6 and tree_bitset.foldl/4.

* A new function, array.generate/2, and new predicate, array.generate_foldl/5,
  can be used to create and fill new arrays.

* We have added the new predicate assoc_list.foldl_keys/4 and
  assoc_list.foldl_values/4 for folding over just keys or values
  an association list.

* We have added the new function array.from_reverse_list/1, which creates
  a new array from a list with the elements of the array occurring in
  the reverse order to that of the list.

NEWS for Mercury 11.01
----------------------

Upcoming changes to the Mercury standard library:

* In the next release after 11.01 we intend to change the argument order of
  many of the predicates in the standard library so as to make them more
  conducive to the use of state variable notation.

  For example, map.insert/4 will be changed from
      
     map.insert(map(K, V)::in, K::in, V::in, map(K, V)::out) is semidet.

  to

     map.insert(K::in, V::in, map(K, V)::in, map(K, V)::out) is semidet.

  As part of this change, the sv* modules will be deprecated; they will
  be removed from the library in a later release.

  Note that none of these upcoming changes affect the 11.01 release.


HIGHLIGHTS
==========

Changes to the Mercury language:

* We have added two new kinds of scopes to the language.

  A scope introduced by one of the new keywords require_det, require_semidet,
  require_multi, require_nondet, require_cc_multi, require_cc_nondet,
  require_erroneous and require_failure, as the name implies, requires
  the goal inside the scope to have the given determinism.
  
  A scope introduced by the keyword require_complete_switch requires the
  goal inside the scope, if it is a switch on the variable named by the scope,
  to be a complete switch, i.e. to have arms for all the function symbols
  in the type of the switched-on variable.

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have added semidet modes for hash_table.fold/4 and
  version_hash_table.fold/4.

* We have added new predicates and functions added to the assoc_list module.
  The predicates map_keys_only/3 map_values_only/3 and map_values/3 complement
  the functions of the same name. The predicates filter/3, negated_filter/3,
  filter/4, merge/3, which also have function versions, do jobs very similar
  to the predicates of the same name in the list module, but do the relevant
  operations on keys instead of entire list elements.

+ We have moved the lazy evaluation module out of the extras distribution and
  into a new standard library module called `lazy'.  It has also been made
  backend-agnostic.

* We have made changes to the list module of the standard library:

  + We added a new predicate list.member_index0/3.  It is like list.member/2
    except that it also takes a parameter representing the zero-based index of
    the element within the list.

  + We added a new predicate list.map3_foldl/7 which maps over a list producing
    three lists and one folded value.
  
  + We added semidet modes with unique accumulators for list.foldl3/8,
    list.foldl4/10, list.foldl5/12, and list.foldl6/14.

* We have added the predicates divide/4 and divide_by_set/4 to the tree_bitset
  module of the standard library.

* We have added the predicates set_ctree234.member/2 and
  set_ctree234.non_empty/1.  We have add the function
  set_ctree234.from_list/1.

* We have added the the predicate set_bbbtree.count/2 and the
  function set_bbbtree.count/1.  These replace the predicate
  set_bbbtree.size/2 which is now deprecated.  

* We have added the predicate set_ordlist.non_empty/1.

* We have added the predicate set_tree234.non_empty/1 and the
  function set_tree234.from_list/1.

* We have added the predicates set_unordlist.non_empty/1 and
  set_unordlist.count/2, and the function set_unordlist.count/1. 

* All of the modules in the standard library that implement the set ADT,
  (set, set_ordlist, set_unordlist, set_bbbtree, set_tree234,
  and set_ctree234), now support folding over sets with up to six
  accumulators.  Modes that provide unique and mostly-unique accumulators
  for set fold have also been added.

* We have made the following changes to the array module of the standard
  library:

  + We have added the functions unsafe_elem/2 and append/2.

  + We have added the predicates svset/4, unsafe_svset/4, foldl2/4, foldl2/6,
    foldr/4, foldr2/6, map_foldl/5, map_corresponding_foldl/6, and member/2.

* We have added the predicates version_array.foldl2/6, version_array.foldr/4,
  and version_array.foldr2/6 to the standard library.

* We have added semidet modes with unique and mostly-unique accumulators for
  the following predicates:
	bimap.foldl2/6
	bimap.foldl3/8
	cord.foldl_pred/4
  	cord.map_foldl/5
	list.map_corresponding_foldl2/8
	list.map_corresponding_foldl3/10
	list.map_corresponding3_foldl/7
	map.foldl3/8

* We have added the predicate unsorted_aggregate2/6 to the solutions module
  of the standard library.

* We have added several predicates and functions to the require module
  of the standard library. The predicates sorry/2 and sorry/3 report
  the absence of a feature, while the predicates unexpected/2 and unexpected/3
  report an internal error in the program; all have function versions too.
  The predicate expect/3 calls unexpected if a condition isn't satisfied.
  We now have expect/4 as well as expect/3. For expect/4 as well as expect/3,
  the first and last arguments are the expected condition and the error message
  respectively, but with expect/4, there are two arguments in the middle
  to specify the location of the error (normally the name of the module
  and of the predicate respectively). We also added expect_not/3 and
  expect_not/4, which are like expect/3 and expect/4 respectively,
  except they expect the condition to be *false*, not true.

Changes to the Mercury compiler:

* We have added a new backend that generates C#.

* Support for building and linking against frameworks on Mac OS X has
  been improved.

Changes to the extras distribution:

* We have added a binding to the Cairo 2D graphics library.


DETAILED LISTING
================

Changes to the Mercury compiler:

* We have added a new backend that generates C#.
  For more details, see the README.CSharp.

  The new backend was contributed by Mission Critical IT
  <http://www.missioncriticalit.com/>.

* We have added two new options, --framework and --framework-directory
  in order to simplify building and linking against frameworks on Mac OS X.
  (-F is supported as a synonym for --framework-directory.)

* Switches on strings in which all output arguments in all switch arms are
  bound to constants are now implemented using lookup tables on the LLDS
  back end. This should make the generated code more compact as well as faster.

For news about earlier versions, see the HISTORY file.

NEWS since Mercury 14.01.x
==========================

Changes that may break compatibility
------------------------------------

* When the Mercury compiler looks at code using Mercury keywords (such as
  `"func"` and `"pred"`) and Mercury operators (such as clause neck operator `":-"`)
  but which cannot be parsed as the Mercury constructs that those Mercury
  keywords and operators are part of, it now generates a specific error
  message for each discrepancy. In the past, when it found such code,
  the compiler considered such code to construct terms and/or to call
  functions and predicates. Usually, the terms did not belong to any
  declared type and the called functions and predicates did not exist,
  leading to confusing error messages from the compiler.

  The compiler's new approach generates considerably better diagnostics,
  but it does mean that code that uses Mercury's keywords and/or operators
  in ways that are inconsistent with Mercury's own uses of those keywords
  and operators will not compile anymore. Such code will need to be changed,
  typically by changing the names of some function symbols, functions
  or predicates.

* Code that switches on a field of a term could previously written directly as

        (
            Term ^ field = value1,
            ...
        ;
            Term ^ field = value2,
            ...
        )

    The compiler would then internally rearrange this as

        Field = Term ^ field,
        (
            Field = value1,
            ...
        ;
            Field = value2,
            ...
        )

    and then recognize this as a switch on `Field`.

    However, it turns out that while this transformation is valid
    in the vast majority of cases (well in excess of 99%), it is not valid
    in some rare circumstances involving terms with unique arguments.
    This means that the current version of the compiler is not allowed
    to do the above transformation automatically, so programmers must
    perform it themselves if needed.

* We have enabled stricter checking of non-ground final insts to reject more
  mode-incorrect code. Due to compiler limitations, some code that should be
  accepted will now be rejected. They will require modifications to appease
  the compiler.

* We have enabled stricter checking of the requirement that a type, inst
  or a mode that is *not* exported from a module may not be used in the
  declarations of entities (such as predicates and typeclasses) that *is*
  exported from that module. This may require the explicit export of e.g.
  some types that previously were not exported.

* We have enabled stricter checking of type declarations and definitions:
  all declarations and definitions of a type must agree on whether the type
  is a solver type or not, and the definitions (as opposed to the names)
  of solver types may not be exported from their defining module.

* We have enabled stricter checking of module accessibility rules.
  If a module `m` has an `import_module` or `use_module` declaration for
  module `x.y.z`, it must also have `import_module` or `use_module` declarations
  for its ancestors `x` and `x.y`. And if the import or use of `x.y.z`
  is in module `m`'s interface, then the import or use of `x.y.z`'s
  ancestor modules must also be in the interface.

* References to everything imported via `:- use_module` declarations
  must now be fully module qualified.

* `for` is now an operator.

* It is now an error for a program to redefine a builtin type. The affected
  type names are:

        int
        int{8,16,32,64}
        uint
        uint{8,16,32,64}
        float
        character
        string
        {}
        =
        pred
        func
        pure
        semipure
        impure
        ''

* It is now an error for a program to redefine a builtin inst. The affected
  inst names are:

        =<
        any
        bound
        bound_unique
        clobbered
        clobbered_any
        free
        ground
        is
        mostly_clobbered
        mostly_unique
        mostly_unique_any
        not_reached
        unique
        unique_any

* It is now an error for a program to redefine a builtin mode. The affected
  mode names are:

        =
        >>
        any_func
        any_pred
        func
        is
        pred

* We have deleted the builtin inst synonyms `old` and `new`: their uses
  should be replaced with `any` and `free` respectively.

* We have deleted the builtin modes `no` and `oo`: their uses should be
  replaced with `oa` and `ia` respectively.

* The minimum version of the Java platform required by Mercury's Java
  backend is now Java SE 8.

* The representation of integer constants in the standard library's `term`
  and `lexer` modules has been generalised. The base, signedness and size of
  each integer constant is now recorded. Furthermore, these modules now use
  arbitrary-precision integers to represent the values of integer constants.

  Code that relies on the old representation of integer constants used by
  the `term` or `lexer` modules may use the `old_term_parser` library in the
  extras instead.

* We have changed the semantics of `int.(<<)` and `int.(>>)` so that they throw
  an exception if their second operand is not in [0, bits_per_int). For now,
  the old behaviour of these operations is provided by the functions
  `int.legacy_left_shift/2` and `int.legacy_right_shift/2`. These functions
  will be deleted in a future release.

* We have changed the semantics of `int.abs/1` so that it throws an exception
  if its argument is equal to `int.min_int`. The old behaviour of this function
  is provided by the new function `int.unchecked_abs/1`.

* We have changed the semantics of `array.map_corresponding_foldl/6` so that it
  throws an exception if the input arrays differ in size.

* We have changed the semantics of `array.shrink/3` and `array.resize/4` so that
  they throw an exception if their first argument is negative.

* We have changed the semantics of `array.fetch_items/4` so that it always
  throws an exception if its second or third argument is out of bounds.
  Previously, it would return an empty if list if its third argument was less
  than the second even if one, or both, of these arguments was out of bounds.

* We have removed the `io.poly_type` equivalence type from the `io` module.
  `string.poly_type` should be used directly. This may require an explicit
  import of the `string` module.

* We have removed legacy support for the following systems:

    - IRIX
    - OSF/1

Changes to the Mercury language
-------------------------------

* We have added nine new primitive types: `uint`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`,
  `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32` and `uint64`. The type `uint` is an
  unsigned integer type of the same size as Mercury's `int` type; the types
  `int8`, `int16`, `int32` and `int64` are signed integer types of width
  8, 16, 32 and 64 bits respectively; the types `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`
  and `uint64` are unsigned integer types of width 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits
  respectively.

    Literals of these new types must have a distinguishing suffix, for example:

        999u
        561i32
        0b1111100111i64
        0o16u8
        0x3e732i64

    Basic operations on the new primitive types are provided by the new standard
    library modules: `uint`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`,
    `uint16`, `uint32` and `uint64`.

* We have added a new kind of scope to the language: determinism checks
for switch arms. These scopes are introduced by any of the new keywords

        require_switch_arms_det
        require_switch_arms_semidet
        require_switch_arms_multi
        require_switch_arms_nondet
        require_switch_arms_cc_multi
        require_switch_arms_cc_nondet
        require_switch_arms_erroneous
        require_switch_arms_failure

    `require_switch_arms_<determinism> [Var] Goal` tells the compiler to require
    `Goal` to be a switch on `Var` in which all the switch arms have determinisms
    at least as tight as `<determinism>`, and to generate error messages
    for any violations of this requirement.

* We have changed the meaning of `require_complete_switch` scopes slightly:
  the compiler now generates an error if the goal inside the scope
  is not a switch on the named variable.

* We have added a new kind of scope to the language for disabling warnings
  within the scope. A goal such as

        disable_warnings [singleton_vars] (
           Goal
        )

    is equivalent to `Goal`, with the exception that the compiler will not
    generate warnings about singleton variables inside `Goal`.

* We have added an extension to include external files
  in `pragma foreign_decl` and `pragma foreign_code` declarations.

* We have added a foreign type assertion `word_aligned_pointer` that
  allows the Mercury implementation to avoid boxing values of the foreign type
  that the assertion is for when the type appears as the sole argument
  of a data constructor.

* We have added a new pragma named `consider_used`. This pragma tells
  the compiler to consider the predicate or function it names to be used,
  preventing it from generating unused procedure warnings either for
  any of its procedures, or for any of the procedures they call,
  directly or indirectly.

* We have added an optional second field to the `obsolete` pragma.
  When present, it may contain a list of the names and arities of
  predicates and/or functions that programmers should consider using
  instead of the obsolete predicate or function.

* We have added an `obsolete_proc` pragma. While the `obsolete` pragma
  declares all modes of a predicate or function to be obsolete, the
  `obsolete_proc` pragma declares only one mode of a predicate or function
  to be obsolete. Like the updated version of the `obsolete` pragma,
  the `obsolete_proc` pragma may have a second argument naming one or more
  suggested replacements.

* The Java backend now supports defining foreign types as primitive Java
  types.

* Digits in numeric literals may now be separated by underscores in order
  to improve readability.

Changes to the Mercury standard library
---------------------------------------

### New Integer Modules

* We have added the new modules `uint`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`,
  `uint16`, `uint32` and `uint64`. These modules provide the basic operations on the
  new integer types.

  Many other standard library modules now have additional predicates that support
  the new integer types; see the entries for those modules for details.

### New Module: `diet`

* This module provides discrete interval encoding trees, which are a highly
  efficient set implementation for fat sets. This module is a contribution
  from Yes Logic Pty. Ltd.

### New Module: `edit_seq`

* This module provides operations for computing and manipulating edit
  sequences. Given two sequences of items, an edit sequence is the shortest
  sequence of edit operations (deletes, inserts and/or replaces) that will
  transform the first sequence into the second.

### New Module: `psqueue`

* This module implements a priority search queue ADT.  This is a blend between
  a priority queue and a map. This was contributed by Matthias Güdemann.

### New Module: `ranges`

* This module represents sets of integer using a sort list of ranges. This module
  export operations that make it particularly suitable for representing domains
  in finite domain constraint solvers.

### New Module: `thread.barrier`

* This module provides the `barrier/0` type. This type can be used to control
  progress in concurrent code. This module was contributed by
  Mission Critical IT.

### New Module: `thread.future`

* This module provides the `future/0` and `future_io/0` types. These type can
  be used to compute values in parallel using other threads. This module was
  contributed by Mission Critical IT.

### Changes to the `array` module

* The following functions and predicates have been added:

    - `det_least_index/1`

    - `semidet_greatest_index/1`
    - `foldl_corresponding/5`
    - `foldl2_corresponding/7`
    - `fill/3`
    - `fill_range/5`
    - `swap/4`
    - `unsafe_swap/4`

* The following functions have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release:

* The following functions and predicates have been added:

    - `is_empty/1`
    - `fill/3`
    - `from_array/3`

### Changes to the `assoc_list` module

* The following predicate has been added:

    - `svremove/4`

* `svremove/4` is like `remove/4` but its arguments are in an order
  more conducive to the use of state variable notation.

### Changes to the `bag` module

* The following functions and predicates have been added:

    - `singleton/1`
    - `insert_duplicates/4`
    - `det_insert_duplicates/4`
    - `det_insert_duplicates/3`

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - `is_empty/1`
    - `det_from_string/1`
    - `get_uint8/1`, `unsafe_get_uint8/1`
    - `set_uint8/4`, `unsafe_set_uint8/4`

### Changes to the `builtin` module

* The following predicate and function have been deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release:

    - `promise_only_solution/1`
    - `promise_only_solution_io/4`

  Existing code that uses either of these should be replaced with code that
  uses a `promise_equivalent_solutions` goal instead.

* The following modes have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release:

    - `input/0`
    - `output/0`

  Existing code that uses these modes should replace their use with `in`
  or `out` respectively.

### Changes to the `calendar` module

* The following functions and predicates have been added:

    - `int_to_month/2`
    - `det_int_to_month/1`
    - `int0_to_month/2`
    - `det_int0_to_month/1`
    - `month_to_int/1`
    - `month_to_int0/1`
    - `same_date/1`

### Changes to the `char` module

    - `is_leading_surrogate/1`, `is_trailing_surrogate/1`
    - `is_control/1`, `is_space_separator/1`, `is_paragraph_separator/1`
    - `is_line_separator/1`, `is_private_use/1`

* The following predicates have been deprecated and will either be removed or
  have their semantics changed in a future release:

    - `is_hex_digit/2`
    - `int_to_hex_char/2`
    - `digit_to_int/2`
    - `int_to_digit/2`
    - `det_int_to_digit/1`, `det_int_to_digit/2`

  NOTE: existing code that calls `digit_to_int/2` assuming that it will
  only succeed for decimal digits (0-9) may be broken.

### Changes to the `cord` module

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - `to_list/1`     (synonym for the existing `list/1` function)
    - `to_rev_list/1` (synonym for the existing `rev_list/1` function)
    - `rev_cord_list_to_cord/1` (similar to `cord_list_to_cord/1`)
    - `rev_cord_list_to_list/1` (similar to `cord_list_to_list/1`)
    - `cons/3`
    - `snoc/3`
    - `find_first_match/3`

### Changes to the `deconstruct` module

* The predicate `functor/4` has been modified so that for character and string
  data, any control characters in the functor representation are escaped.

### Changes to the `digraph` module

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - `return_vertices_in_from_to_order/2`
    - `return_vertices_in_to_from_order/2`
    - `return_sccs_in_from_to_order/1`
    - `return_sccs_in_to_from_order/1`

### Changes to the `float` module

* The following predicates and function have been added:

    - `is_finite/1`
    - `is_zero/1`
    - `is_infinite/1`        (synonym for the existing `is_inf/1` predicate)
    - `is_nan_or_infinite/1` (synonym for the existing `is_nan_or_inf/1` predicate)
    - `infinity/0`

### Changes to the `getopt` and `getopt_io` modules

* We have added variants of the `process_options` predicates that return errors
  using a type instead of strings.  A new function, `option_error_to_string/1`,
  can be used to convert values of the new error type into strings.

### Changes to the `hash_table` module

* The following predicates have been added:

    - `fold2/6`
    - `fold3/8`

### Changes to the `int` module

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - `all_true_in_range/3`
    - `unchecked_abs/1`
    - `nabs/1`

### Changes to the `integer` module

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - `from_string/2`
    - `from_base_string/3`
    - `to_int/2`
    - `det_to_int/1`
    - `to_base_string/2`
    - `negative_one/0`, `two/0`, `ten/0`
    - `is_zero/1`
    - `to_uint/2`
    - `det_to_uint/1`
    - `from_uint/1`
    - `to_int{8,16,32,64}/2`
    - `det_to_int{8,16,32,64}/1`
    - `from_int{8,16,32,64}/1`
    - `to_uint{8,16,32,64}/2`
    - `det_to_uint{8,16,32,64}/1`
    - `from_uint{8,16,32,64}/1`

* The following functions have been deprecated and will be removed in a
  future release:

    - `from_string/1`
    - `from_base_string/2`
    - `int/1`

### Changes to the `io` module

* The following predicates have been added:

    - `write_uint/3`, `write_uint/4`
    - `write_int{8,16,32,64}/3`, `write_int{8,16,32,64}/4`
    - `write_uint{8,16,32,64}/3`, `write_uint{8,16,32,64}/4`
    - `write_binary_int8/3`, `write_binary_int8/4`
    - `write_binary_uint8/3`, `write_binary_uint8/4`
    - `write_binary_int{16,32,64}/3`, `write_binary_int{16,32,64}/4`
    - `write_binary_int{16,32,64}_{le,be}/3`, `write_binary_int{16,32,64}_{le,be}/4`
    - `read_binary_int8/[34]`
    - `read_binary_uint8/[34]`
    - `putback_int8/[34]`
    - `putback_uint8/[34]`
    - `read_binary_int{16,32,64}/3`, `read_binary_int{16,32,64}/4`
    - `read_binary_int{16,32,64}_{le,be}/3`, `read_binary_int{16,32,64}_{le,be}/4`
    - `read_binary_uint{16,32,64}/3`, `read_binary_uint{16,32,64}/4`
    - `read_binary_uint{16,32,64}_{le,be}/3`, `read_binary_uint{16,32,64}_{le,be}/4`
    - `read_line_as_string_and_num_code_units/[34]`
    - `print_line/[34]`, `write_line/[34]`

    - `temp_directory/3`
    - `make_temp_directory/3`
    - `make_temp_directory/5`
    - `set_environment_var/5`
    - `have_set_environment_var/0`
    - `seek_binary_input64/5`, `seek_binary_output64/5`
    - `binary_input_stream_offset64/4`, `binary_output_stream_offset64/4`

* The `print_line` and `write_line` family of predicates behave like the
  `print` and `write` predicates, but also write a terminating newline.

* `print` now outputs arbitrary precision integers in their decimal form
   instead of printing their underlying representation.

* The predicate `set_environment_var/5` returns an `io.res` value rather than
  throwing an exception. The predicate `have_set_environment_var/0` can test
  whether the current platform supports the ability to set environment variables.

* We have made the following predicates exception safe: the current input or
  output stream is restored to the original stream if an exception is thrown
  during their execution:

     - `read/4`
     - `write_list/6`
     - `write_array/6`
     - `read_binary/4`
     - `write_binary/4`

### Changes to the `lexer` module

* We have added predicates that read from an explicitly specified input stream,
  not from the current input stream.

### Changes to the `list` module

* The following predicates and functions have been added:

    - `any_true/2`
    - `any_false/2`
    - `reverse_prepend/2`
    - `reverse_prepend/3`
    - `take_while/4`
    - `take_while/3`
    - `take_while/2`
    - `drop_while/3`
    - `drop_while/2`
    - `one_or_more_to_list/1`
    - `list_to_one_or_more/2`
    - `list_to_one_or_more_det/2`

* The following predicate has been deprecated and will be remove in a future
  release:

    - `takewhile/4` (use `take_while/4` instead)

* The `take/3` and `drop/3` predicates have been modified so that they fail if
  their first argument is less than zero.

* The `split_upto/4` and `take_upto/3` predicates and `take_upto/2` function
  have been modified so that they throw an exception if their first argument
  is negative.

### Changes to the `map` module

* The following predicates have been added:

    - `foldl5/12`
    - `foldr5/12`
    - `map_foldl4/11`
    - `intersect_list/4`
    - `union_list/4`
    - `select_unselect/4`
    - `select_unselect_sorted_list/4`

### Changes to the `math` module

* The following function and predicate have been added:

    - `fma/3`
    - `have_fma/0`

* `fma/3` provides the fused multiply-add operation on platforms that
  support that operation. The predicate `have_fma/0` may be used to check for
  this support.

### Changes to the `maybe` module

* We have a added a new type, `maybe_errors`, to the `maybe` module.

* The following predicate and function have been added:

    - `fold2_maybe/6`
    - `maybe_default/2`
    - `pred_to_maybe/1`
    - `func_to_maybe/1`

### Changes to the `parser` module

* We have added predicates that read from an explicitly specified input stream,
  not from the current input stream.

### Changes to the `pretty_printer` module

* The type `formatter_limit` has been renamed to `func_symbol_limit`, since
  this better reflects the type's purpose.

* We have replaced the `set_formatter` function with a predicate of the same
  name, since this allows the use of state variable notation when setting up more
  than one type-specific formatter,

* We have renamed the `write_doc_to_stream` predicate as `put_doc`, to better
  fit in with the names other predicates that operate on values of the
  `stream.writer` typeclass, and changed its interface to group the prettyprinter
  parameters together in a value of the type that was designed for this purpose.

### Changes to the `rbtree` module

* The following predicates have been added:

    - `foldl_values/4`
    - `foldl2_values/6`

### Changes to the `require` module

* The following predicate and function have been added:

    - `error/2`

Changes to the Mercury compiler
-------------------------------

* We have extended tail call optimization from self recursive calls only
  to mutually recursive calls as well, when generating high level C code,
  C# code, or Java code. (The compiler has long been able apply tail call
  optimization to mutually recursive calls when generating low level C code.)

* We have added a new option `--warn-dead-preds`. While the existing option
  `--warn-dead-procs` asks the compiler to generate warnings for every
  unused procedure of the module being compiled, the new option asks
  the compiler to generate a warning for an unused procedure only if
  none of the procedures of a predicate or function is used.

* We have added a new option `--warn-implicit-stream-calls`, which asks
  the compiler to generate a warning for every call to a predicate p/n
  if there is also a predicate p/(n+1) which differs from p/n only in that
  it has additional argument at the front of its argument list that specifies
  an I/O stream. This is intended to generate warnings for calls to predicates
  such as `io.write_string/3`, which writes to the current output stream,
  to encourage programmers to call `io.write_string/4` instead. If the option
  is given, the compiler will also generate warnings for calls to predicates
  such as `io.see`, `io.seen`, `io.tell` and `io.told`, which set the current input
  or output streams respectively.

* We have added a new option `--warn-non-contiguous-decls`, which asks
  the compiler to generate a warning if the mode declaration(s) of a
  predicate or function does not immediately follow its `:- pred` or `:- func`
  declaration. This is option is turned on by default.

* We have added the new options `--warn-inconsistent-pred-order-clauses`
  and `--warn-inconsistent-pred-order-foreign-procs`. Both of these ask the
  compiler to generate a warning if, among either (a) the set of exported
  predicates and functions of the module, or (b) the set of nonexported
  predicates and functions of the module, the order of their definitions
  does not match the order of their declarations. The first option
  applies only to predicates and functions defined by Mercury clauses;
  the second applies to predicates and functions defined by either
  Mercury clauses or foreign procedures.

    The option `--warn-inconsistent-pred-order` is a shorter synonym for
    `--warn-inconsistent-pred-order-clauses`.

* We have added a new option `--inhibit-style-warnings`, which tells
  the compiler not to generate any warnings that are purely about
  programming style, and do not point out code that is reasonably likely
  to be wrong.

* We have added a new option `--inline-linear-tail-rec-sccs` that tells
  the compiler, when it finds a set of procedures that each contain
  one tail call to one *other* member of the set, to inline the tail calls
  to turn those mutually recursive procedures into procedures that each
  contain only *self* tail recursion.

* We have significantly improved the compiler's ability to detect, and
  to generate warnings about, code that violates the occurs check.

* We have fixed a long-standing bug causing crashes in deep profiling
  grades, related to unify/compare for tuples. (Bug #3)

* We have fixed some bugs with constrained polymorphic modes.

* The compiler now reports an error for binary/octal/hexadecimal integer
  literals that cannot be represented in the compiler's native `int` type.

* Class files generated for executables in the Java grade are now automatically
  packaged up into Java archives (JARs).

* The `--generate-module-order` and `--imports-graph` options no longer imply
  `--generate-dependencies`.

* The compiler does not set the runtime search path when
  `--mercury-linkage=static` is used.

* We have added an option `--no-default-runtime-library-directory` to
  prevent the compiler adding any directories to the runtime search path
  automatically.

* We have renamed the `--inhibit-accumulator-warnings` option to
  `--no-warn-accumulator-swaps`.

* We have disabled intermodule optimisation of any predicates or functions
  using `try` goals. This fixes a serious issue as `try` goals are not
  properly written to `.opt` files, so when read back would not actually
  catch any exceptions.

* We have disabled the old `--num-reserved-objects` option.

* We have upgraded the bundled Boehm GC to v7.6.10 and libatomic_ops to v7.6.2.

Portability improvements
------------------------

* The `asm_fast*` and `reg*` grades now work on 64-bit Intel OS X systems when
  using GCC as the C compiler.

  See README.MacOS for further details.

* We have improved support for FreeBSD, specifically:

    - Allowing architectures other than `i*86`.
    - Allowing the use of shared libraries.
    - Enabling support for threads.
    - Enabling parallel job support with `mmc --make`.

  See README.FreeBSD for further details.

* We have added support for OpenBSD.

  See README.OpenBSD for further details.

* We have added support for Linux systems using musl libc.

* We have improved support for AIX.

  See README.AIX for further details.

Changes to the Mercury debugger
-------------------------------

* Interactive queries are now supported on OS X.

* The `break` command can now auto-complete on the filename:linenumber pairs
  of events, provided the Mercury system can access the readline library.

* Interactive queries have been improved:

    - Queries can use variable bindings from the current environment.
    - Exceptions thrown from queries are properly handled.
    - Non-canonical output bindings are now printed in solutions.
    - Underscore variables are no longer printed in solutions.

* We have added a `browse --web` command to view terms in a web browser.

Changes to the extras distribution
----------------------------------

* We have added support for Unicode and other enhancements to the `lex` and
  `regex` libraries. Thanks to Sebastian Godelet.

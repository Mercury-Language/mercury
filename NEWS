NEWS since Mercury 12.08
------------------------

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have added predicates to the calendar module for folding over the days
  in a given range of dates: foldl_days/5, foldl2_days/7 and  foldl3_days/9.

Changes to the Mercury compiler:

* Generation of 64-bit code on Windows using the MinGW64 port of GCC
  is now supported, i.e. the x86_64-w64-mingw32 architecture is now
  supported.


NEWS for Mercury 12.08
----------------------

Changes to the Mercury standard library:

* We have swapped the argument order of the predicates set.singleton_set/2,
  set_bbbtree.singleton_set/2, set_ordlist.singleton_set/2 and
  set_unordlist.singleton_set/2 so that it conforms with the order in the
  other set modules.

* All the modules that operate on sets now have two new predicates.
  One is insert_new: if the item is not already in the set, it inserts
  the item, otherwise it fails. The other is all_true: it succeeds if
  and only if all elements in the set pass a test.

* The map and varset modules each have a new predicate that deletes
  a sorted list of items from a map or varset, and can do so faster than
  usual by exploiting the order.

* The map, bimap and tree234 modules each have a new predicate that does
  a search, and if the search is unsuccessful, does an insertion during
  the *same* traversal.

* The argument order of the following predicates has been changed so as to
  make them more conducive to the use of state variable notation:
  pqueue.insert/4, pqueue.remove/4, stack.push/3, stack.push_list/3,
  stack.pop/3 and stack.det_pop/3.

* We have added versions of the operations in the math module that omit the
  domain checks.

* We have added new predicates to the parsing_utils module:
  input_string/3, get_skip_whitespace_pred/2 and next_char_no_progress/4.

* The lexer module returns base 10 integer literals in the string
  representation, if the integer is too large for an `int'.

* We have add the following new predicates to the list module:
  list.all_true_corresponding/3, list.all_false_corresponding/3 and
  list.same_length3/3.

* We have added the type maybe.maybe_error/2 which is also polymorphic in
  the type of the error.

Changes to the Mercury compiler:

* The option `--warn-non-tail-recursion' no longer requires
  `--high-level-code'.

Changes to the Mercury debugger:

* We have added new capabilities to the "level", "retry" and "finish" mdb
  commands. If these commands are given the argument "clentry", they will
  operate on the ancestor of the current call that represents entry to the
  clique of mutually recursive procedures that the current call belongs to.
  If they are given the argument "clparent", they will operate on the parent
  of that call.

* The mdb command "stack" can now find and mark cliques of mutually recursive
  calls on the stack, and can (and by default, will) impose a limit on the
  number of lines it prints for each clique.

Changes to the extras distribution:

* We have added a binding to the GLFW library.

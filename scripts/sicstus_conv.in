# This sed script is used to convert from Mercury to Sicstus Prolog
# It does three things: delete the `:- module' line,
# expand backslash escapes, and replace the use
# of `^' for xor in calls to is/2 with `#'.
# The expansion of backslash escapes includes support for
# "\c" line continuation sequences, whereby the sequence
#	backslash, "c", whitespace
# acts merely as layout text and is deleted from string literals;
# this allows string literals to extend over multiple lines, as in
#	X = "foo\c
#		bar".
# which is the same as X = "foobar".

# The commands for expanding \c are a bit complicated;
# here's an explanation.  
#
#       % this is the start of loop
#	:l
#		% if we see \c followed by any number of
#		% spaces, tabs, or embedded newlines (\n), and then finally
#		% followed by a non-embedded newline ($), we use the `N'
#		% command to read in the next line; we then branch to
#		% label `l' to start the loop again.
#		/\\c\( *	*\n*\)*$/{
#			N
#			b l
#		}
#		% at this point, we've read in all the lines of the \c
#		% command, so we replace the \c followed by any number of
#		% spaces, tabs, or embedded newlines (\n) with an empty
#		% string.
#		% 
#		/\\c\( *	*\n*\)*/s///g

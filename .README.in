THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
But in some cases, additional steps may be needed for particular
operating systems or particular architectures, so first read the
README file for your particular platform, if there is one:

	README.AIX		RS/6000 systems running AIX
	README.FreeBSD		The FreeBSD version of BSD Unix on Intel x86
	README.HPUX		HPPA systems running HPUX
	README.IRIX-5		SGI IRIX version 5.x
	README.Linux		Linux on Intel x86
	README.Linux-Alpha	Linux on DEC Alpha
	README.Linux-PPC	Linux on PowerPC
	README.Linux-m68k	Linux on Motorola 68000
	README.MacOS		Apple PowerPC Mac systems running MacOS 10
	README.MS-Windows	Microsoft Windows
	README.OSF1		DEC Alpha systems running OSF/1 version 3.x
	README.Solaris		Solaris (SunOS) on SPARC or Intel x86.

The documentation sources are in the `doc' subdirectory.  The installation
process will install INFO, HTML, and DVI versions in the locations specified
in the file Mmake.common - by default these locations are
/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/info,
/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/html,
and /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/doc respectively.
The installation process will also install Unix-style man pages -
by default they will be installed in /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/man/man1.
The files RELEASE_NOTES, NEWS, HISTORY, LIMITATIONS, and BUGS
also contain useful information.  If you're interested in looking
at the source code, the file compiler/notes/compiler_design.html is
a good place to start.

The `samples' directory contains some example Mercury programs.
There are also some additional Mercury programs and libraries
in the `extras' directory.

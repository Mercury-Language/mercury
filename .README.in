	General Public License.  See the file COPYING for copying permission.

The subdirectory `boehm_gc' contains a slightly modified copy of version
7.4.2 of the conservative garbage collector distributed by Hans Boehm:

    The file boehm_gc/linux_threads.c is also

        Copyright (c) 1998 by Fergus Henderson. All rights reserved.

    The files boehm_gc/Makefile.am, and boehm_gc/configure.in are

	THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED
	OR IMPLIED.  ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

	Permission is hereby granted to use or copy this program
	for any purpose,  provided the above notices are retained on all copies.
	Permission to modify the code and to distribute modified code is granted,
	provided the above notices are retained, and a notice that the code was
	modified is included with the above copyright notice.

	A few files have other copyright holders. A few of the files needed
	to use the GNU-style build procedure come with a modified GPL license
	that appears not to significantly restrict use of the collector, though
	use of those files for a purpose other than building the collector may
	require the resulting code to be covered by the GPL.

    The atomic_ops library (libatomic_ops) contains some code that
    is covered by the GNU General Public License, but is not needed by, nor
    linked into the collector library or Mercury. It is included here only
    because the libatomic_ops distribution is included in its entirety.

A few files (config.guess, config.sub) are derived from code that is
copyright by the Free Software Foundation, Inc, and are distributed
under the GNU General Public License version 2.

The files in the `samples' directory are either public domain, or
distributed under the GNU General Public License.

THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  See the file COPYING.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
In some cases, additional steps may be needed for particular operating systems
or particular architectures, so first read the README file for your particular
platform, if there is one:

	README.AIX		RS/6000 systems running AIX
	README.FreeBSD		The FreeBSD version of BSD Unix on Intel x86
	README.HPUX		HPPA systems running HPUX
	README.Linux		Linux on Intel x86 and x86_64
	README.Linux-Alpha	Linux on DEC Alpha
	README.Linux-PPC	Linux on PowerPC
	README.Linux-m68k	Linux on Motorola 68000
	README.MacOS		Apple Mac systems running Mac OS X
	README.MS-Windows	Microsoft Windows
	README.Solaris		Solaris (SunOS) on SPARC or Intel x86.

The documentation sources are in the `doc' subdirectory.  The installation
process will install INFO, HTML, and DVI versions in the locations specified
in the file Mmake.common - by default these locations are
/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/info,
/usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/html,
and /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/lib/mercury/doc respectively.
The installation process will also install Unix-style man pages -
by default they will be installed in /usr/local/mercury-@VERSION@/man/man1.
The files RELEASE_NOTES, NEWS, HISTORY, LIMITATIONS, and BUGS
also contain useful information.  If you're interested in looking
at the source code, the file compiler/notes/compiler_design.html is
a good place to start.

The `samples' directory contains some example Mercury programs.
There are also some additional Mercury programs and libraries
in the `extras' directory.

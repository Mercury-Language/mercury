This directory contains tests for the `--smart-recompilation' option.
The output with `--verbose-recompilation' is checked to make sure
that recompilation occurs when expected.

Most of the tests consist of two modules, a main module and a module
imported from the main module. The `.1' or `.2' after
the file name is a version number.
The tests are run as follows:
	Compile the program using the `.1' versions of each module.
	Check the expected output.
	Update the imported module to version `.2'.
	Check the expected output.	
	Check that the `.err' files contain the correct
	`--verbose-recompilation' messages.

Tests with names ending in `_nr' result in no recompilation
of the main module after the change to the imported module.

Tests with names ending in `_r' should recompile the main module.

Tests with names ending in `_re' should recompile the main module,
reporting an error in the recompilation.

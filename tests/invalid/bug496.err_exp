bug496.m:022: In `options_to_action'(in, in, out):
bug496.m:022:   error: determinism declaration not satisfied.
bug496.m:022:   Declared `det', inferred `nondet'.
bug496.m:022:   The reasons for the difference are the following.
bug496.m:050:   Inside the case [|]/2 of the switch on AllActions:
bug496.m:050:   disjunction has multiple clauses with solutions.
bug496.m:050:   In argument 2 of functor `[|]/2':
bug496.m:050:   unification with `list.[]' can fail.
bug496.m:053:   In argument 2 of functor `[|]/2':
bug496.m:053:   unification with `list.[V_11 | V_12]' can fail.
bug496.m:050:   It is possible that the cause of the declared determinism not
bug496.m:050:   being satisfied is the inability of determinism analysis to
bug496.m:050:   recognize that a disjunction (usually created by the compiler
bug496.m:050:   for a switch arm) is a switch on a *subterm* of a variable when
bug496.m:050:   the instantiation state of that variable is at least partially
bug496.m:050:   unique. This is because converting such a disjunction to a
bug496.m:050:   switch requires replacing several unifications, one in each arm
bug496.m:050:   of the disjunction, that each unify the variable representing
bug496.m:050:   the subterm (e.g. the tail of a list) with the same function
bug496.m:050:   symbol, with just one unification before the disjunction, but
bug496.m:050:   due to limitations of the current modechecker, this
bug496.m:050:   transformation could destroy the uniqueness.
bug496.m:050:   In cases where this uniqueness is not needed, the programmer
bug496.m:050:   can fix the determinism error by performing this transformation
bug496.m:050:   manually.

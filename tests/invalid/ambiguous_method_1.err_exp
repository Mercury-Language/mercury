ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   All types occurring in typeclass constraints must
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   be fully determined. A type is fully determined if
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   one of the following holds:
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   1) All type variables occurring in the type are
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   determined.
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   2) The type occurs in a constraint argument, that
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   argument is in the range of some functional
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   dependency for that class, and the types in all of
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   the domain arguments for that functional dependency
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   are fully determined.
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   A type variable is determined if one of the
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   following holds:
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   1) The type variable occurs in the argument types
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   of the predicate, function, or constructor which is
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   constrained.
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   2) The type variable occurs in a type which is
ambiguous_method_1.m:022:   fully determined.

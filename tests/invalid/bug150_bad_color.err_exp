Error in the value of the `--color-scheme' option: `cow' is not the name of a
  known color, the #RRGGBB specification of a 24 bit color, or a decimal
  integer between 0 and 255 specifying an 8 bit color.
Error in the value of the `--color-scheme' option: expected a string of the
  form `role=color' where `role' is one of `subject', `correct', `incorrect',
  `inconsistent' and `hint', got `holy=8'.

freefree.m:020: Warning: [38;5;203munresolved polymorphism[39;49m in predicate [38;5;87m`p'/0.[39;49m
freefree.m:020:   The variables with unbound types were:
freefree.m:020:     [38;5;203m`X',[39;49m
freefree.m:020:     [38;5;203m`Y'.[39;49m
freefree.m:020:   Their types will be implicitly set to the builtin type
freefree.m:020:   `void'.
freefree.m:020:   This usually means that the body of the clause contains a
freefree.m:020:   call to a polymorphic predicate, but I cannot determine which
freefree.m:020:   version should be called, because the types of the variables
freefree.m:020:   listed above are not known. (I ought to tell you which call
freefree.m:020:   caused the problem, but I am afraid you will have to work it
freefree.m:020:   out yourself. My apologies.)
freefree.m:023: In clause for `p':
freefree.m:023:   mode error in unification of `X' and `Y'.

freefree.m:020: In predicate `p'/0:
freefree.m:020:   warning: unresolved polymorphism.
freefree.m:020:   The variables with unbound types were:
freefree.m:020:     X
freefree.m:020:     Y
freefree.m:020:   Their types will be implicitly set to the builtin type
freefree.m:020:   `void'.
freefree.m:020:   The body of the clause contains a call to a polymorphic
freefree.m:020:   predicate, but I can't determine which version should be
freefree.m:020:   called, because the types of the variables listed above are
freefree.m:020:   not known. (I ought to tell you which call caused the
freefree.m:020:   problem, but I am afraid you will have to work it out
freefree.m:020:   yourself. My apologies.)
freefree.m:023: In clause for `p':
freefree.m:023:   mode error in unification of `X' and `Y'.
freefree.m:023:   Variable `X' has instantiatedness `free',
freefree.m:023:   variable `Y' has instantiatedness `free'.

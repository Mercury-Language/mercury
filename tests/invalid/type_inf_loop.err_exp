Type inference iteration limit exceeded. This probably indicates that your
  program has a type error. You should declare the types explicitly. (The
  current limit is 60 iterations. You can use the
  `--type-inference-iteration-limit' option to increase the limit).
For more information, recompile with `-E'.

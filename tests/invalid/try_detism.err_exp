try_detism.m:010:   error: `cc_nondet' is not a valid determinism for a
try_detism.m:010:   predicate that has I/O state arguments. The valid
try_detism.m:010:   determinisms for such predicates are `det', `cc_multi' and
try_detism.m:010:   `erroneous', since the I/O state can be neither duplicated
try_detism.m:010:   nor destroyed.
try_detism.m:010: In `p'(out, di, uo):
try_detism.m:010:   error: determinism declaration not satisfied.
try_detism.m:010:   Declared `cc_multi', inferred `cc_nondet'.
try_detism.m:010:   The reason for the difference is the following.
try_detism.m:017:   In argument 1 of call to predicate `try_detism.q'/3:
try_detism.m:017:   unification with `X' can fail.
try_detism.m:016: Error: call to predicate `exception.magic_exception_result'/1
try_detism.m:016:   with determinism `cc_multi' occurs in a context which
try_detism.m:016:   requires all solutions.
try_detism.m:017:   Unification of X and V_17 can fail.
try_detism.m:016: In clause for `p(out, di, uo)':
try_detism.m:016:   in call to predicate `exception.try_io'/4:
try_detism.m:016:   mode error: arguments
try_detism.m:016:   `TryLambda, TryResult, STATE_VARIABLE_IO_10, TryIOOutput'
try_detism.m:016:   have the following insts:
try_detism.m:016:     /* unique */ (pred(out, di, uo) is semidet),

try_detism.m:016:     unique,
try_detism.m:016:     free
try_detism.m:016:   which does not match any of the modes for predicate
try_detism.m:016:   `exception.try_io'/4.
try_detism.m:016:   The first argument `TryLambda' has inst
try_detism.m:016:     /* unique */ (pred(out, di, uo) is semidet),
try_detism.m:016:   which does not match any of those modes.
try_detism.m:016:   (For higher order insts like this, the mismatch is
try_detism.m:016:   sometimes caused by the arity of the predicate or function
try_detism.m:016:   being different in the inst than in the type.)

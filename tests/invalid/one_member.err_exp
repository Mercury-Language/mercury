one_member.m:052: Error: unification for non-canonical type
one_member.m:052:   `one_member.set_ctree234/1' occurs in a context which
one_member.m:052:   requires all solutions.
one_member.m:052:   Since the type has a user-defined equality predicate, I
one_member.m:052:   must presume that there is more than one possible concrete
one_member.m:052:   representation for each abstract value of this type. The
one_member.m:052:   results of this unification might depend on the choice of
one_member.m:052:   concrete representation. Finding all possible solutions to
one_member.m:052:   this unification would require backtracking over all
one_member.m:052:   possible representations, but I'm not going to do that
one_member.m:052:   implicitly. (If that's really what you want, you must do it
one_member.m:052:   explicitly.)
one_member.m:053:   Call to do_one_member can fail.
one_member.m:061: Error: `promise_equivalent_solution_sets' scope is nested

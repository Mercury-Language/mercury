unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   type error: unsatisfied typeclass constraints:
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:     `unsatisfiable_constraint.a(A, B, A, V_8)',
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:     `unsatisfiable_constraint.a(A, B, C, V_14)',
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:     `unsatisfiable_constraint.b(A, C)'
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   The constraints are due to:
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:043:     a goal here,

unsatisfiable_constraint.m:045:     a goal here.
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039: In predicate `test'/1:
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   warning: unresolved polymorphism.
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   The variables with unbound types were:
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:     B
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:     C
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   Their types will be implicitly set to the
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   builtin type `void'.
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   The body of the clause contains a call to a
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   polymorphic predicate, but I can't determine
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   which version should be called, because the
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   types of the variables listed above are not
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   known. (I ought to tell you which call caused
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   the problem, but I am afraid you will have to
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   work it out yourself. My apologies.)

unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   This usually means that the body of the

unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   predicate, but I cannot determine which
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   version should be called, because the types
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   of the variables listed above are not known.
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   (I ought to tell you which call caused the
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   problem, but I am afraid you will have to
unsatisfiable_constraint.m:039:   work it out yourself. My apologies.)

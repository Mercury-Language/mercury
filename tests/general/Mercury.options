# with `--no-strip', otherwise it gets a seg fault. 
# The test case ../hard_coded/mode_choice suffers from a similar problem.
# This is probably a bug in one of the underlying tools (e.g. the Solaris
# linker) rather than a bug in Mercury, and since it is goes away when you
# compile with debugging information, it is very difficult to debug.
# It is much easier to just work around it this way rather than
# tracking it down.

# Also, it's not worth doing the check for these test cases anyway since
# the entire point of them is to check that string.format aborts when
# passed an invalid format string.

type_vars.m:010: In declaration for type `t1'/0:
type_vars.m:010:   error in type class constraints: type variable `T2' occurs
type_vars.m:010:   in the constraints, but is not determined by the
type_vars.m:010:   constructor's argument types.
type_vars.m:010:   All types occurring in typeclass constraints must be fully
type_vars.m:010:   determined. A type is fully determined if one of the
type_vars.m:010:   following holds:
type_vars.m:010:   1) All type variables occurring in the type are determined.
type_vars.m:010:   2) The type occurs in a constraint argument, that argument
type_vars.m:010:   is in the range of some functional dependency for that
type_vars.m:010:   class, and the types in all of the domain arguments for that
type_vars.m:010:   functional dependency are fully determined.
type_vars.m:010:   A type variable is determined if one of the following holds:
type_vars.m:010:   1) The type variable occurs in the argument types of the
type_vars.m:010:   predicate, function, or constructor which is constrained.
type_vars.m:010:   2) The type variable occurs in a type which is fully
type_vars.m:010:   determined.
type_vars.m:010:   See the "Functional dependencies" section of the reference
type_vars.m:010:   manual for details.
type_vars.m:012: Error: the existentially quantified type variable `T2' does
type_vars.m:012:   not occur either in the arguments or in the constraints of
type_vars.m:012:   the constructor.
type_vars.m:013: Error: type variable `T1' has overlapping scopes (the explicit
type_vars.m:013:   existential type quantifier shadows the universal
type_vars.m:013:   quantification implicit in it being a type parameter).
type_vars.m:014: Error: the type variable `T2' occurs in a class constraint
type_vars.m:014:   without being explicitly existentially quantified using
type_vars.m:014:   `some'.

# This is the central place where the version number is kept.
#
# Note also that:
# + the version number is hard coded in the README file, it should always
#   match the version number below.
# + The version number for the last major release is hard-coded in the
#   RELEASE_NOTES file.
#
# The version number must be a valid file name, i.e. it should
# not contain whitespace or special characters.  Stick to [A-Za-z0-9._-].
#
# Please assign version numbers according to the scheme explained below.

VERSION=DEV

# We use the following general scheme for version numbers:
#
# Pattern	Examples	Explanation
# -------	-------		-----------
# YY.MM		09.04, 10.10 	Major releases are named after the
# 				year and month they are released in.
#
# YY.MM.*	10.04.1		Bug-fix releases.
# 				Note these releases are named after
# 				the year and month the orginal release
# 				was made in.
#
# rotd-<DATE>	rotd-1997-07-28 "Release-of-the-day" releases.
#				These releases are snapshots of our
#				development sources built automatically
#				after they have passed our nightly
#				automatic test process.
#
# <BASE>-<PATCH> 		"Unofficial" releases (releases of patched
# 		0.6.2-1		versions by anyone other than the Mercury
#				team).  BASE should be the official
#				release on which it is based,
#				e.g. "0.7", or "rotd-97-07-28".
#				PATCH should be something uniquely
#				identifying this release.
#				(In the example "0.6.2-1", PATCH was "1",
#				which is not a good choice.  Something like
#				"0.6.2-debian1" would have been a better name.)
#
# DEV		 DEV		Generic version number used internally by
# 				the Mercury team for development versions.
#
# DEV-<NAME>	 DEV-blah	Version numbers used internally by
# 				the Mercury team for specific development
#				versions.

This file documents the Linux/x86 and Linux/x86_64 ports.
For the Linux/PowerPC port, see README.Linux-PPC.
For the Linux/Apha port, see README.Linux-Alpha.
(Ports to Linux on other architectures have not yet
been attempted, but should not be difficult.)

Linux systems that produce executables in a.out format are not supported by
the Mercury compiler.


BUILDING A 32-BIT MERCURY COMPILER ON 64-BIT LINUX
==================================================

To build a 32-bit Mercury compiler on 64-bit Linux, follow these steps:

(1) Ensure that the 32-bit (e.g. i686 etc) packages for the C compiler and
    libraries are available on the build system.

(2) Ensure that you have a working Mercury compiler in your PATH
    to bootstrap from.

(3) Run aclocal -I m4; autoconf as normal.  Then invoke configure
    as follows:

        $ ./configure --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu --with-cc="gcc -m32"

(4) Do mmake; mmake install as normal.

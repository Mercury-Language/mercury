/*
** Ideally, MR_trace_retry works by resetting the state of the stacks and
** registers to the state appropriate for the call to the selected ancestor,
** setting *jumpaddr to point to the start of the code for the selected
** ancestor, and returning MR_RETRY_OK_DIRECT.
**
** If resetting the stacks requires discarding the stack frame of a procedure
** whose evaluation method is memo or loopcheck, we must also reset the call
** table entry for that particular call to uninitialized. There are two reasons
** for this. The first is that the call table entry was uninitialized at the
** time of the first call, so if the retried call is to do what the original
** call did, it must find the call table entry in the same state. The second
** reason is that if we did not reset the call table entry, then the retried
** call would find the "call active" marker left by the original call, and
** since this normally indicates an infinite loop, it will generate a runtime
** abort.
**
** Unfortunately, resetting the call table entry to uninitialized does not work
** in general for procedures whose evaluation method is minimal model tabling.
** In such procedures, a subgoal can be a consumer as well as a generator,
** and control passes between consumers and generators in a complex fashion.
** There is no safe way to reset the state of such a system, except to wait
** for normal forward execution to execute the completion operation on an
** SCC of mutually dependent subgoals.
**
** If the stack segments between the current call and the call to be retried
** contain one or more such complete SCCs, then MR_trace_retry will return
** either MR_RETRY_OK_FINISH_FIRST or MR_RETRY_OK_FAIL_FIRST. The first
** indicates that the `retry' command should be executed only after a `finish'
** command on the selected call has made the state of the SCC quiescent.
** However, if the selected call is itself a generator, then reaching one of
** its exit ports is not enough to make its SCC quiescent; for that, one must
** wait for its failure. This is why in such cases, MR_trace_retry will ask
** for the `retry' command to be executed only after a `fail' command.
** 
** If the fail command reaches an exception port on the selected call instead
** of the fail port, then the SCC cannot be made quiescent, and MR_trace_retry
** will return MR_RETRY_ERROR, putting a description of the error into
** *problem. It will also do this for other, more prosaic problems, such as
** when it finds that some of the stack frames it looks at lack debugging
** information.
**
** Retry across I/O is unsafe in general, at least for now. It is therefore
** only allowed if in_fp and out_fp are both non-NULL, and if the user, when
** asked whether he/she wants to perform the retry anyway, says yes.

This directory contains a binary distribution of the
University of Melbourne Mercury compiler, version <VERSION>,
built on a `<FULLARCH>' system.

The Mercury implementation is free software, but it is Copyright (C)
1993-2006 The University of Melbourne.  It is distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  See the file COPYING for
copying permission.  The Mercury library and runtime (libmer_std.* and
libmer_rt.*) are distributed under the terms of the GNU Library General
Public License.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying permissions for
those files.  (If these licencing arrangements are unsatisfactory,
please contact us!  We are willing to come to alternative arrangements,
if the need should arise.)

This distribution also contains a slightly modified version of the
conservative garbage collector distributed by Hans Boehm, version 6.5,
which has the following copyright attached (taken from the README file
of the garbage collector source):

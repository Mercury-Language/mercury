@chapter Common programming errors

@enumerate

@item
@emph{What does the error message ``undefined symbol @samp{'.'/2}'' mean?}
@sp 1

You need to explicitly import the @samp{list} module

@example
:- import_module list.
@end example

@noindent
if your code uses lists. Similarly, if your code uses arithmetic operations,
you will need to import the @samp{int} and possibly @samp{float} modules.

@sp 1
@item
@emph{Why doesn't @samp{X <= 3} work?}
@sp 1

In Mercury, less-than-or-equal-to is written as @samp{=<} not
as @samp{<=}, which is used for reverse implication.

@sp 1
@item
@emph{I defined a type like this: @samp{:- type number ---> int ; float.}
Why doesn't this work?}
@sp 1

You tried to define a type that is an undiscriminated union of two types,
which is not allowed by the Mercury type system.
The declaration above defines an enumerated type with two constants,
``int'' and ``float''.
This is not what you want, but it is legal Mercury,
which is why you don't get an error message on the type declaration itself.

@sp 1
@item
@emph{I get a ``scope error'' in an if-then-else.
I checked and both branches bind the same variables. What is the error?}
@sp 1

This error generally happens if you attempt bind non-local variables
in the @emph{condition} of the if-then-else.  For example, the following
code attempts to bind @samp{Value} in the call to @samp{map__search},
but @samp{Value} occurs outside of the if-then-else --- in particular,
it occurs in the head of the clause.

@example
:- pred map__search(map(K, V), K, V).
:- mode map__search(in, in, out) is semidet.

:- pred lookup(map(string, int), string, int).
:- mode lookup(in, in, out) is det.

lookup(Map, Key, Value) :-
        (if map__search(Map, Key, Value) then
                true
        else
                Value = -1
        ).
@end example

Binding non-local variables in the condition of an if-then-else
is forbidden since it would be unsound; it would lead to inconsistent
results.  For example, @samp{(X = 1 -> Y = 1 ; Y = 2), X = 2} would fail,
but @samp{X = 2, (X = 1 -> Y = 1 ; Y = 2)} would succeed --- breaking
one of the fundamental laws of logic, @samp{(P, Q) <=> (Q, P)}.

Mode analysis therefore rejects such programs. 
(In certain rare circumstances, the compiler may report this as a
``mode error'' rather than a ``scope error''.)
The way to fix such errors is to avoid binding non-local
variables in the @emph{condition}, and instead bind them in the @emph{then}
part of the if-then-else.  So in the above example, you should introduce
a new local variable, which we will call @samp{Value1}:

@example
lookup(Map, Key, Value) :-
        (if some [Value1]
                map__search(Map, Key, Value1)
        then
                Value = Value1
        ;
                Value = -1
        ).
@end example

@noindent
The explicit existential quantifier is optional; if you
prefer a slightly more succinct style you can write this as

@example
lookup(Map, Key, Value) :-
        ( map__search(Map, Key, Value1) ->
                Value = Value1
        ;
                Value = -1
        ).
@end example

@item
@emph{``I keep getting a link error @samp{undefined symbol init_gc}.  Why?''}
@sp 1

If you are using @samp{mmake} to recompile your program, and you are
overriding the default grade (e.g. by setting @samp{GRADE=asm_fast} in your
@samp{Mmake} file), you must make sure that you do @samp{mmake clean} every
time you change grades.

@end enumerate

@node Unimplemented
@chapter Problems caused by unimplemented Mercury features

@enumerate
@item
@emph{How can I avoid getting a compile-time error when I try to
fill in a partially instantiated data structure?}
@sp 1

At the moment, you can create a partially instantiated data structure,
but you can't fill in the holes.
The reason is that the code that does the filling in
must temporarily alias two variables together,
and the current mode checker does not allow this.
This limitation will go away in the future.

@sp 1
@item
@emph{I'm getting an error from the C compiler:}
@example
foo.c:45: initializer is not computable at load time
@end example
@sp 1

You're using an old version of @samp{gcc}. 
Check that the version of @samp{gcc} in your PATH is version 2.6.3 or later.
Mercury does not (at the current time) support versions of gcc earlier
than 2.6.3.  (Using the @samp{--no-static-ground-terms} option may also solve
this problem, but results in less efficient code.)

@end enumerate

@node Last resort
@chapter What to do when all else fails

@enumerate

@item
@emph{I'm getting an error message that I don't understand.  What can I do?}
@sp 1

Try compiling with the @samp{-E} (@samp{--verbose-error-messages}) option.
This option causes the compiler to give even more verbose descriptions
than usual.

@sp 1
@item
@emph{I followed the instructions in the user's guide,
but it still didn't work. What do I do next?}
@sp 1

Send email to @code{mercury-bugs@@cs.mu.oz.au},
and we'll try to solve your problem.

@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This document describes the compilation environment of Mercury.
It describes how to use @samp{mmc}, the Mercury compiler;
a build tool integrated into the compiler called @samp{mmc --make};
an older tool, @samp{mmake}, built on top of ordinary or GNU make
to simplify the handling of Mercury programs;
how to use @samp{mdb}, the Mercury debugger;
and how to use @samp{mprof}, the Mercury profiler.

We strongly recommend that programmers use @samp{mmc --make} rather
than invoking @samp{mmc} directly, because @samp{mmc --make} is generally
easier to use and avoids unnecessary recompilation.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Filenames
@chapter File naming conventions
@cindex File extensions
@cindex File names

Mercury source files must be named @file{*.m}.
Each Mercury source file should contain a single Mercury module
whose module name should be the same as the filename without
the @samp{.m} extension.

The Mercury implementation uses a variety of intermediate files, which
are described below.  But all you really need to know is how to name
source files.  For historical reasons, the default behaviour is for
intermediate files to be created in the current directory, but if you
use the @samp{--use-subdirs} option to @samp{mmc} or @samp{mmake}, all
@findex --use-subdirs
these intermediate files will be created in a @file{Mercury}
subdirectory, where you can happily ignore them.
Thus you may wish to skip the rest of this chapter.

In cases where the source file name and module name don't match,
the names for intermediate files are based on the name of the
module from which they are derived, not on the source file name.

Files ending in @file{.int}, @file{.int0}, @file{.int2} and @file{.int3}
are interface files; these are generated automatically by the compiler,
using the @samp{--make-interface} (or @samp{--make-int}),
@samp{--make-private-interface} (or @samp{--make-priv-int}),
@samp{--make-short-interface} (or @samp{--make-short-int}) options.
@findex --make-int
@findex --make-interface
@findex --make-short-int
@findex --make-short-interface
@findex --make-priv-interface
@findex --make-private-interface
@findex --make-optimization-interface
@findex --make-transitive-optimization-interface
@findex --make-trans-opt-int
Files ending in @file{.opt} are
interface files used in inter-module optimization,
and are created using the @samp{--make-optimization-interface}
(or @samp{--make-opt-int}) option.
Similarly, files ending in @file{.trans_opt} are interface files used in
transitive inter-module optimization, and are created using the
@samp{--make-transitive-optimization-interface}
(or @samp{--make-trans-opt-int}) option.

Since the interface of a module changes less often than its implementation,
the @file{.int}, @file{.int0}, @file{.int2}, @file{.int3}, @file{.opt},
and @file{.trans_opt} files will remain unchanged on many compilations.
To avoid unnecessary recompilations of the clients of the module,
the timestamps on the these files are updated only if their contents change.
@file{.date}, @file{.date0}, @file{.date3}, @file{.optdate},
and @file{.trans_opt_date}
files associated with the module are used as timestamp files;
they are used when deciding whether the interface files need to be regenerated.

@file{.c_date}, @file{.cs_date}, @file{.java_date} and @file{.erl_date} files
perform a similar function for @file{.c}, @file{.cs}, @file{.java} and
@file{.erl}, files respectively.
When smart recompilation (@pxref{Auxiliary output options}) works out that a
module does not need to be recompiled, the timestamp file for the target file
is updated, and the timestamp of the target file is left unchanged.
@findex --smart-recompilation

@file{.used} files contain dependency information for smart recompilation
(@pxref{Auxiliary output options}).
@findex --smart-recompilation

Files ending in @file{.d} are automatically generated Makefile fragments
which contain the dependencies for a module.
Files ending in @file{.dep} are automatically generated Makefile fragments
which contain the rules for an entire program.
Files ending in @file{.dv} are automatically generated Makefile fragments
which contain variable definitions for an entire program.

As usual, @file{.c} files are C source code,
and @file{.o} files are object code.
In addition, @file{.pic_o} files are object code files
that contain position-independent code (PIC).
@file{.lpic_o} files are object code files that can be
linked with shared libraries, but don't necessarily
contain position-independent code themselves.
@file{.mh} and @file{.mih} files are C header files generated
by the Mercury compiler. The non-standard extensions are necessary
to avoid conflicts with system header files.
@file{.java}, @file{.class} and @file{.jar} files are Java source code,
Java bytecode and Java archives respectively.
@file{.cs} files are C# source code.
@c XXX mention .dll and .exe?
@file{.erl} and @file{.beam} files are Erlang source code and
bytecode (object) files respectively.
@file{.beams} directories are collections of @file{.beam} files which
act like a library archive.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Using mmc
@chapter Using the Mercury compiler

Following a long Unix tradition,
the Mercury compiler is called @samp{mmc}
(for ``Melbourne Mercury Compiler'').
@pindex mmc
Some of its options (e.g.@: @samp{-c}, @samp{-o}, and @samp{-I})
have a similar meaning to that in other Unix compilers.

Arguments to @samp{mmc} may be either file names (ending in @samp{.m}),
or module names, with @samp{.} (rather than @samp{__} or @samp{:})
as the module qualifier.  For a module name such as @samp{foo.bar.baz},
the compiler will look for the source in files @file{foo.bar.baz.m},
@file{bar.baz.m}, and @file{baz.m}, in that order.
Note that if the file name does not include all the module
qualifiers (e.g.@: if it is @file{bar.baz.m} or @file{baz.m}
rather than @file{foo.bar.baz.m}), then the module name in the
@samp{:- module} declaration for that module must be fully qualified.
To make the compiler look in another file for a module, use
@samp{mmc -f @var{sources-files}} to generate a mapping from module name
to file name, where @var{sources-files} is the list of source files in
the directory (@pxref{Output options}).

Arguments to @samp{mmc} may also be in @samp{@@file}.
The @samp{@@file} argument is replaced with arguments
representing the contents of the file.
This argument processing is done recursively.
The contents of the @samp{@@file} is split into arguments
one per line in the file.

To compile a program which consists of just a single source file,
use the command

@example
mmc @var{filename}.m
@end example

Unlike traditional Unix compilers, however,
@samp{mmc} will put the executable into a file called @file{@var{filename}},
not @file{a.out}.

For programs that consist of more than one source file, you can use Mmake
(@pxref{Using Mmake}) or the @samp{--make} option to @samp{mmc}. Currently, the
use of @samp{mmc --make} is recommended:

@example
mmc --make @var{filename}
@end example

@noindent
If you use Mmake or @samp{mmc --make}, then you don't need to understand the
details
of how the Mercury implementation goes about building programs.
Thus you may wish to skip the rest of this chapter.

To compile a source file to object code without creating an executable,
use the command

@example
mmc -c @var{filename}.m
@end example

@samp{mmc} will put the object code into a file called @file{@var{module}.o},
where @var{module} is the name of the Mercury module defined in
@file{@var{filename}.m}.
It also will leave the intermediate C code in a file called
@file{@var{module}.c}.
If the source file contains nested modules, then each submodule will get
compiled to separate C and object files.

Before you can compile a module,
you must make the interface files
for the modules that it imports (directly or indirectly).
You can create the interface files for one or more source files
using the following commands:

@example
mmc --make-short-int @var{filename1}.m @var{filename2}.m @dots{}
mmc --make-priv-int @var{filename1}.m @var{filename2}.m @dots{}
mmc --make-int @var{filename1}.m @var{filename2}.m @dots{}
@end example
@findex --make-short-int
@findex --make-priv-int
@findex --make-int

If you are going to compile with @samp{--intermodule-optimization} enabled,
then you also need to create the optimization interface files.

@example
mmc --make-opt-int @var{filename1}.m @var{filename2}.m @dots{}
@end example
@findex --make-opt-int

If you are going to compile with @samp{--transitive-intermodule-optimization}
enabled, then you also need to create the transitive optimization files.
@findex --transitive-intermodule-optimization

@example
mmc --make-trans-opt @var{filename1}.m @var{filename2}.m @dots{}
@end example
@findex --make-trans-opt

Given that you have made all the interface files,
one way to create an executable for a multi-module program
is to compile all the modules at the same time
using the command

@example
mmc @var{filename1}.m @var{filename2}.m @dots{}
@end example

This will by default put the resulting executable in @file{@var{filename1}},
but you can use the @samp{-o @var{filename}} option to specify a different
name for the output file, if you so desire.
@findex -o

The other way to create an executable for a multi-module program
is to compile each module separately using @samp{mmc -c},
@findex -c
and then link the resulting object files together.
The linking is a two stage process.

First, you must create and compile an @emph{initialization file},
which is a C source file
containing calls to automatically generated initialization functions
contained in the C code of the modules of the program:

@example
c2init @var{module1}.c @var{module2}.c @dots{} > @var{main-module}_init.c,
mgnuc -c @var{main-module}_init.c
@end example
@pindex c2init
@pindex mgnuc

The @samp{c2init} command line must contain
the name of the C file of every module in the program.
The order of the arguments is not important.
The @samp{mgnuc} command is the Mercury GNU C compiler;
it is a shell script that invokes the GNU C compiler @samp{gcc}
@c (or some other C compiler if GNU C is not available)
with the options appropriate for compiling
the C programs generated by Mercury.

You then link the object code of each module
with the object code of the initialization file to yield the executable:

@example
ml -o @var{main-module} @var{module1}.o @var{module2}.o @dots{} @var{main_module}_init.o
@end example
@pindex ml

@samp{ml}, the Mercury linker, is another shell script
that invokes a C compiler with options appropriate for Mercury,
this time for linking.  @samp{ml} also pipes any error messages
from the linker through @samp{mdemangle}, the Mercury symbol demangler,
so that error messages refer to predicate and function names from
the Mercury source code rather than to the names used in the intermediate
C code.

The above command puts the executable in the file @file{@var{main-module}}.
The same command line without the @samp{-o} option
would put the executable into the file @file{a.out}.

@samp{mmc} and @samp{ml} both accept a @samp{-v} (verbose) option.
You can use that option to see what is actually going on.
For the full set of options of @samp{mmc}, see @ref{Invocation}.

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Running
@chapter Running programs

Once you have created an executable for a Mercury program,
you can go ahead and execute it.  You may however wish to specify
certain options to the Mercury runtime system.
The Mercury runtime accepts
options via the @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS} environment variable.
@vindex MERCURY_OPTIONS
The most useful of these are the options that set the size of the stacks.
(For the full list of available options, see @ref{Environment}.)

@c XXX FIXME This is wrong for the case when --high-level-code is enabled.
@c Note: The definition for these defaults is in runtime/mercury_wrapper.c
The det stack and the nondet stack
are allocated fixed sizes at program start-up.
The default size is 4096k times the word size (in bytes) for the det stack
and 64k times the word size (in bytes) for the nondet stack,
but these can be overridden with the
@samp{--detstack-size} and @samp{--nondetstack-size} options,
@findex --detstack-size
@findex --nondetstack-size
whose arguments are the desired sizes of the det and nondet stacks
respectively, in units of kilobytes.
On operating systems that provide the appropriate support,
the Mercury runtime will ensure that stack overflow
is trapped by the virtual memory system.
@cindex Stack size
@cindex Stack overflow

With conservative garbage collection (the default),
the heap will start out with a zero size,
and will be dynamically expanded as needed,
When not using conservative garbage collection,
the heap has a fixed size like the stacks.
The default size is 8Mb times the word size (in bytes),
but this can be overridden with the @samp{--heap-size} option.
@cindex Heap size
@cindex Heap overflow

@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Using Mmake
@chapter Using Mmake
@pindex mmake
@pindex make --- see Mmake
@cindex Building programs
@cindex Recompiling

Mmake, short for ``Mercury Make'',
is a tool for building Mercury programs.
The same functionality is now provided in @samp{mmc} directly by using the
@samp{--make} option:

@example
mmc --make @var{main-module}
@end example

@noindent
The usage of Mmake is discouraged.

Mmake is built on top of GNU Make.
With Mmake, building even a complicated Mercury program
consisting of a number of modules is as simple as

@example
mmc -f @var{source-files}
mmake @var{main-module}.depend
mmake @var{main-module}
@end example

Mmake only recompiles those files that need to be recompiled,
based on automatically generated dependency information.
Most of the dependencies are stored in @file{.d} files that are
automatically recomputed every time you recompile,
so they are never out-of-date.
A little bit of the dependency information
is stored in @file{.dep} and @file{.dv} files
which are more expensive to recompute.
The @samp{mmake @var{main-module}.depend} command which recreates
the @file{@var{main-module}.dep} and @file{@var{main-module}.dv} files
needs to be repeated only when you either
add a module to your program or remove a module from it.
There is no danger of getting an inconsistent executable
if you forget this step ---
instead you will get a compile or link error.

The @samp{mmc -f} step above is only required if there are any source files
for which the file name does not match the module name.
@samp{mmc -f} generates a file named @file{Mercury.modules}
containing a mapping from module name to source file.
The @file{Mercury.modules} file must be updated
when a source file for which the file name does not match the module name
is added to or removed from the directory.

@samp{mmake} allows you to build more than one program in the same directory.
Each program must have its own @file{.dep} and @file{.dv} files,
and therefore you must run @samp{mmake @var{program}.depend} for each program.
The @samp{Mercury.modules} file is used for all programs in the directory.

If there is a file called @file{Mmake} or @file{Mmakefile}
in the current directory,
Mmake will include that file in its automatically generated Makefile.
The @samp{Mmake} file can override
the default values of various variables used by Mmake's builtin rules,
or it can add additional rules, dependencies, and actions.

Mmake's builtin rules are defined by the file
@file{@var{prefix}/lib/mercury/mmake/Mmake.rules}
(where @var{prefix} is @file{/usr/local/mercury-@var{version}} by default,
and @var{version} is the version number, e.g.@: @samp{0.6}),
as well as the rules and variables in the automatically generated
@file{.dep} and @file{.dv} files.
These rules define the following targets:

@table @file
@item @var{main-module}.depend
Creates the files @file{@var{main-module}.dep} and
@file{@var{main-module}.dv} from @file{@var{main-module}.m}
and the modules it imports.
This step must be performed first.
It is also required whenever you wish to change the level of
inter-module optimization performed (@pxref{Overall optimization options}).

@item @var{main-module}.all_ints
Ensure that the interface files for @var{main-module}
and its imported modules are up-to-date.
(If the underlying @samp{make} program does not handle transitive dependencies,
this step may be necessary before
attempting to make @file{@var{main-module}} or @file{@var{main-module}.check};
if the underlying @samp{make} is GNU Make, this step should not be necessary.)

@item @var{main-module}.check
Perform semantic checking on @var{main-module} and its imported modules.
Error messages are placed in @file{.err} files.

@item @var{main-module}
Compiles and links @var{main-module} using the Mercury compiler.
Error messages are placed in @file{.err} files.

@c XXX mention .dlls and .exe targets?

@item lib@var{main-module}
Builds a library whose top-level module is @var{main-module}.
This will build a static object library, a shared object library
(for platforms that support it), and the necessary interface files.
For more information, see @ref{Libraries}.

@item lib@var{main-module}.install
Builds and installs a library whose top-level module is @var{main-module}.
This target will build and install a static object library and
(for platforms that support it) a shared object library,
for the default grade and also for the additional grades specified
in the @code{LIBGRADES} variable.  It will also build and install the
necessary interface files. The variable @code{INSTALL} specifies
the name of the command to use to install each file, by default
@samp{cp}. The variable @code{INSTALL_MKDIR} specifies the command to use
to create directories, by default @samp{mkdir -p}.
@vindex LIBGRADES
@vindex LIB_LINKAGES
@vindex INSTALL
@vindex INSTALL_MKDIR

@item @var{main-module}.clean
Removes the automatically generated files
that contain the compiled code of the program
and the error messages produced by the compiler.
Specifically, this will remove all the @samp{.c}, @samp{.o},
@samp{.pic_o}, @samp{.prof}, @samp{.used}, @samp{.mih},
and @samp{.err} files
belonging to the named @var{main-module} or its imported modules.
Use this target whenever you wish to change compilation model
(@pxref{Compilation model options}).
This target is also recommended whenever you wish to change the level
of inter-module optimization performed (@pxref{Overall optimization
options}) in addition to the mandatory @var{main-module}.depend.

@item @var{main-module}.realclean
Removes all the automatically generated files.
In addition to the files removed by @var{main-module}.clean, this
removes the @samp{.int}, @samp{.int0}, @samp{.int2},
@samp{.int3}, @samp{.opt}, @samp{.trans_opt},
@samp{.date}, @samp{.date0}, @samp{.date3}, @samp{.optdate},
@samp{.trans_opt_date},
@samp{.mh} and @samp{.d} files
belonging to one of the modules of the program,
and also the various possible executables, libraries and dependency files
for the program as a whole ---
@samp{@var{main-module}},
@samp{lib@var{main-module}.a},
@samp{lib@var{main-module}.so},
@samp{@var{main-module}.init},
@samp{@var{main-module}.dep}
and
@samp{@var{main-module}.dv}.

@item clean
This makes @samp{@var{main-module}.clean} for every @var{main-module}
for which there is a @file{@var{main-module}.dep} file in the current
directory, as well as deleting the profiling files
@samp{Prof.CallPair},
@samp{Prof.Counts},
@samp{Prof.Decl},
@samp{Prof.MemWords}
and
@samp{Prof.MemCells}.

@item realclean
This makes @samp{@var{main-module}.realclean} for every @var{main-module}
for which there is a @file{@var{main-module}.dep} file in the current
directory, as well as deleting the profiling files as per the @samp{clean}
target.

Options to pass to the linker and the c2init program.
@code{C2INITFLAGS} and @code{EXTRA_C2INITFLAGS} are obsolete synonyms
for @code{MLFLAGS} and @code{EXTRA_MLFLAGS} (@code{ml} and @code{c2init}
take the same set of options).
(Note that compilation model options and extra files to be processed by
c2init should not be specified in @code{C2INITFLAGS} --- they should be
specified in @code{GRADEFLAGS} and @code{C2INITARGS}, respectively.)

@item C2INITARGS and EXTRA_C2INITARGS
@vindex C2INITARGS
@vindex EXTRA_C2INITARGS
Extra files to be processed by c2init.  These variables should not be
used for specifying flags to c2init (those should be specified in
@code{MLFLAGS}) since they are also used to derive extra dependency
information.

@item EXTRA_LIBRARIES
@vindex EXTRA_LIBRARIES
A list of extra Mercury libraries to link into any programs or libraries
that you are building.
Libraries should be specified using their base name; that is, without any
@samp{lib} prefix or extension.
For example, the library including the files @file{libfoo.a} and
@file{foo.init} would be referred to as just @samp{foo}.
@xref{Using libraries with Mmake}.
@xref{Using installed libraries with mmc --make}.

@item EXTRA_LIB_DIRS
@vindex EXTRA_LIB_DIRS
A list of extra Mercury library directory hierarchies to search when
looking for extra libraries.  @xref{Using libraries with Mmake}.
@xref{Using installed libraries with mmc --make}.

@item INSTALL_PREFIX
@vindex INSTALL_PREFIX
The path to the root of the directory hierarchy where the libraries,
etc.@: you are building should be installed.  The default is to install in
the same location as the Mercury compiler being used to do the install.

@item INSTALL
@vindex INSTALL
The command used to install each file in a library. The command should
take a list of files to install and the location to install them.
The default command is @samp{cp}.

@item INSTALL_MKDIR
@vindex INSTALL_MKDIR
The command used to create each directory in the directory hierarchy
where the libraries are to be installed. The default command is
@samp{mkdir -p}.

@item LIBGRADES
@vindex LIBGRADES
A list of additional grades which should be built when installing libraries.
The default is to install the Mercury compiler's default set of grades.
Note that this may not be the set of grades in which the standard libraries
were actually installed.
@vindex GRADEFLAGS
Note also that any @code{GRADEFLAGS} settings will also be applied when
the library is built in each of the listed grades, so you may not get what
you expect if those options are not subsumed by each of the grades listed.

@item LIB_LINKAGES
@vindex LIB_LINKAGES
A list of linkage styles (@samp{shared} or @samp{static}) for which libraries
should be built and installed.  The default is to install libraries for both
static and shared linking.  This variable only has an effect with
@samp{mmc --make}.
@end table

Other variables also exist --- see
@file{@var{prefix}/lib/mercury/mmake/Mmake.vars} for a complete list.

If you wish to temporarily change the flags passed to an executable,
rather than setting the various @samp{FLAGS} variables directly, you can
set an @samp{EXTRA_} variable.  This is particularly intended for
use where a shell script needs to call mmake and add an extra parameter,
without interfering with the flag settings in the @samp{Mmakefile}.

For each of the variables for which there is version with an @samp{EXTRA_}
prefix, there is also a version with an @samp{ALL_} prefix that
is defined to include both the ordinary and the @samp{EXTRA_} version.
If you wish to @emph{use} the values any of these variables
in your Mmakefile (as opposed to @emph{setting} the values),
then you should use the @samp{ALL_} version.

It is also possible to override these variables on a per-file basis.
For example, if you have a module called say @file{bad_style.m}
which triggers lots of compiler warnings, and you want to disable
the warnings just for that file, but keep them for all the other modules,
then you can override @code{MCFLAGS} just for that file.  This is done by
setting the variable @samp{MCFLAGS-bad_style}, as shown here:

@example
MCFLAGS-bad_style = --inhibit-warnings
@end example

Mmake has a few options, including @samp{--use-subdirs}, @samp{--use-mmc-make},
@samp{--save-makefile}, @samp{--verbose}, and @samp{--no-warn-undefined-vars}.
For details about these options, see the man page or type @samp{mmake --help}.

Finally, since Mmake is built on top of GNU Make, you can also
make use of the features and options supported by the underlying Make.
In particular, GNU Make has support for running jobs in parallel, which
is very useful if you have a machine with more than one CPU.

As an alternative to Mmake, the Mercury compiler now contains a
significant part of the functionality of Mmake, using @samp{mmc}'s
@samp{--make} option.
@findex --make

The advantages of the @samp{mmc --make} over Mmake are that there
is no @samp{mmake depend} step and the dependencies are more accurate.

Note that @samp{--use-subdirs} is automatically enabled if you specify
@samp{mmc --make}.

@cindex Options files
@cindex Mercury.options
The Mmake variables above can be used by @samp{mmc --make} if they
are set in a file called @file{Mercury.options}. The @file{Mercury.options}
file has the same syntax as an Mmakefile, but only variable assignments and
@samp{include} directives are allowed.
All variables in @file{Mercury.options} are treated as if they are
assigned using @samp{:=}.
Variables may also be set in the environment, overriding settings in
options files.

@samp{mmc --make} can be used in conjunction with Mmake. This is useful
for projects which include source code written in languages other than
Mercury.  The @samp{--use-mmc-make} Mmake option disables Mmake's
Mercury-specific rules. Mmake will then process source files written in
other languages, but all Mercury compilation will be done by
@samp{mmc --make}.  The following variables can be set in the Mmakefile
to control the use of @samp{mmc --make}.

@table @code

@item MERCURY_MAIN_MODULES
@vindex MERCURY_MAIN_MODULES
The top-level modules of the programs or libraries being built in
the directory.  This must be set to tell Mmake to use @samp{mmc --make}
to rebuild the targets for the main modules even if those files already
exist.

@item MC_BUILD_FILES
@vindex MC_BUILD_FILES
Other files which should be built with @samp{mmc --make}.
This should only be necessary for header files generated by the
Mercury compiler which are included by the user's C source files.

@item MC_MAKE_FLAGS and EXTRA_MC_MAKE_FLAGS
@vindex MC_MAKE_FLAGS
@vindex EXTRA_MC_MAKE_FLAGS
Options to pass to the Mercury compiler only when using @samp{mmc --make}.

@end table

The following variables can also appear in options files but are
@emph{only} supported by @w{@samp{mmc --make}}.

@table @code

@item GCC_FLAGS
@vindex GCC_FLAGS
Options to pass to the C compiler, but only if the C compiler is GCC.
If the C compiler is not GCC then this variable is ignored.
These options will be passed @emph{after} any options given by the
@samp{CFLAGS} variable.

@item CLANG_FLAGS
@vindex CLANG_FLAGS
Options to pass to the C compiler, but only if the C compiler is clang.
If the C compiler is not clang then this variable is ignored.
These options will be passed @emph{after} any options given by the
@samp{CFLAGS} variable.

@item MSVC_FLAGS
@vindex MSVC_FLAGS
Options to pass to the C compiler,
but only if the C compiler is Microsoft Visual C.
If the C compiler is not Visual C then this variable is ignored.
These options will be passed @emph{after} any options given by the
@samp{CFLAGS} variable.

Often you will want to use a particular set of Mercury modules
in more than one program.  The Mercury implementation
includes support for developing libraries, i.e.@: sets of Mercury modules
intended for reuse.  It allows separate compilation of libraries
and, on many platforms, it supports shared object libraries.

@end menu

@node Writing libraries
@section Writing libraries

A Mercury library is identified by a top-level module,
which should contain all of the modules in that library as submodules.
It may be as simple as this @file{mypackage.m} file:

@example
:- module mypackage.
:- interface.
:- include_module foo.
:- include_module bar.
:- include_module baz.
@end example

@noindent
This defines a module @samp{mypackage} containing submodules
@samp{mypackage.foo}, @samp{mypackage.bar}, and @samp{mypackage.baz}.

It is also possible to build libraries of unrelated modules,
so long as the top-level module imports all the necessary modules.
For example:

@example
:- module blah.
:- implementation.
:- import_module fee.
:- import_module fie.
:- import_module foe.
:- import_module fum.
@end example

@noindent
This example defines a module @samp{blah},
which has no functionality of its own,
and which is just used for grouping the unrelated modules
@samp{fee}, @samp{fie}, @samp{foe}, and @samp{fum}.
To avoid a warning about the interface of this module being empty,
this module would have to be compiled with @samp{--no-warn-nothing-exported}.
Alternatively, the library could of course just export something,
such as a predicate that returns its version number.

Generally it is better style for each library
to consist of a single module which encapsulates its submodules,
as in the first example,
rather than just a group of unrelated modules,
as in the second example.

@subsection Building and installing libraries with mmc --make

To build a library from the source @samp{mypackage.m}
(and other included modules),
run @samp{mmc} with the following arguments:

@example
mmc --make libmypackage
@end example

@noindent
@samp{mmc} will create static (non-shared) object libraries
and, on most platforms, shared object libraries;
however, we do not yet support the creation of dynamic link
libraries (DLLs) on Windows.
Use the @samp{mmc} option @samp{--lib-linkage} to specify which versions of the
library should be created: @samp{shared} or @samp{static}. The
@samp{--lib-linkage} option can be specified multiple times.
In our example, the files @samp{libmypackage.a} and @samp{libmypackage.so}
should appear in the current directory.

Other programs can more easily use a library that is installed.
To install the library, issue the following command:

@example
mmc --make --install-prefix <dir> libmypackage.install
@end example

@noindent
@samp{mmc} will create the directory @samp{<dir>/lib/mercury} and install the
library there.
The library will be compiled in all valid grades and with all interface files.
Because several grades are usually compiled, installing the library can be a lengthy
process.
You can specify the set of installed grades using the option
@samp{--no-libgrade} followed by @samp{--libgrade <grade>} for all grades you
wish to install.

If no @samp{--install-prefix <dir>} is specified, the library will be installed
in the standard location, next to the Mercury standard library.

@node Using installed libraries with mmc --make
@subsection Using installed libraries with mmc --make
@cindex Libraries, linking with
@findex --mld
@findex --mercury-library-directory
@findex --ml
@findex --mercury-library

Once a library is installed, it can be used by running @samp{mmc} with the
following options:

@example
mmc @dots{} --ml mypackage @dots{} --ml myotherlib @dots{} --ml my_yet_another_lib @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
If a library was installed in a different place (using @samp{--install-prefix
<dir>}), you will also need to add this option:

@example
mmc @dots{} --mld <dir>/lib/mercury @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
Note that @samp{/lib/mercury} has to be added to the searched path. The
@samp{--mld} option can be used several times to add more directories to the
library search path.

You can also specify whether to link executables with the shared or static
versions of Mercury libraries using @samp{--mercury-linkage shared} or
@samp{--mercury-linkage static}.

@node Using non-installed libraries with mmc --make
@subsection Using non-installed libraries with mmc --make
@cindex Libraries, linking with
@findex --search-lib-files-dir
@findex --init-file
@findex --link-object

Suppose the user wants to link against library @samp{mypackage} without
installing the library. The source of the library is stored in the directory
@samp{<dir>} and that the library has been properly built using @samp{mmc
--make libmypackage}. To link against the library, the following options have
to be added to @samp{mmc}:

@example
mmc @dots{} --search-lib-files-dir <dir> \
        --init-file <dir>/mypackage.init \
        --link-object <dir>/libmypackage.a \
    @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
Note that the option @samp{--ml} is not used.

You need to make sure the library @samp{libmypackage.a} and the main program
were compiled in the same grade.

If you need to experiment with more grades, be sure to build the library in all
the grades (building several times using @samp{mmc --grade <grade> --make
libmypackage}) and use the @samp{libmypackage.a} that is compatible with your
main program's grade:

@example
mmc @dots{} --use-grade-subdirs \
        --grade <grade> \
        --search-lib-files-dir <dir> \
        --init-file <dir>/mypackage.init \
        --link-object <dir>/Mercury/<grade>/*/Mercury/lib/libmypackage.a \
    @dots{}

@subsection Building libraries with Mmake
@cindex Shared objects
@cindex Shared libraries
@cindex Static libraries
@cindex Position independent code
@cindex PIC (position independent code)

Generally Mmake will do most of the work of building
libraries automatically.  Here's a sample @code{Mmakefile} for
creating a library.

@example
MAIN_TARGET = libmypackage
depend: mypackage.depend
@end example

The Mmake target @samp{lib@var{foo}} is a builtin target for
creating a library whose top-level module is @samp{@var{foo}.m}.
The automatically generated Mmake rules for the target @samp{lib@var{foo}}
will create all the files needed to use the library.
(You will need to run @samp{mmake @var{foo}.depend} first
to generate the module dependency information.)

Mmake will create static (non-shared) object libraries
and, on most platforms, shared object libraries;
however, we do not yet support the creation of dynamic link
libraries (DLLs) on Windows.
Static libraries are created using the standard tools @command{ar} and
@command{ranlib}.
Shared libraries are created using the @samp{--make-shared-lib}
option to @samp{ml}.
The automatically generated Make rules for @samp{libmypackage}
will look something like this:

@example
libmypackage: libmypackage.a libmypackage.so \
                $(mypackage.ints) $(mypackage.int3s) \
                $(mypackage.opts) $(mypackage.trans_opts) mypackage.init

libmypackage.a: $(mypackage.os)
        rm -f libmypackage.a
        $(AR) $(ARFLAGS) libmypackage.a $(mypackage.os) $(MLOBJS)
        $(RANLIB) $(RANLIBFLAGS) mypackage.a

libmypackage.so: $(mypackage.pic_os)
        $(ML) $(MLFLAGS) --make-shared-lib -o libmypackage.so \
                $(mypackage.pic_os) $(MLPICOBJS) $(MLLIBS)

libmypackage.init:
        @dots{}

clean:
        rm -f libmypackage.a libmypackage.so
@end example
@vindex AR
@vindex ARFLAGS
@vindex MLOBJS
@vindex RANLIB
@vindex RANLIBFLAGS
@vindex ML
@vindex MLFLAGS
@vindex MLPICOBJS
@vindex MLLIBS

If necessary, you can override the default definitions of the variables
such as @samp{ML}, @samp{MLFLAGS}, @samp{MLPICOBJS}, and @samp{MLLIBS}
to customize the way shared libraries are built.  Similarly @samp{AR},
@samp{ARFLAGS}, @samp{MLOBJS}, @samp{RANLIB}, and @samp{RANLIBFLAGS}
control the way static libraries are built.  (The @samp{MLOBJS} variable
is supposed to contain a list of additional object files to link into
the library, while the @samp{MLLIBS} variable should contain a list of
@samp{-l} options naming other libraries used by this library.
@samp{MLPICOBJS} is described below.)

Note that to use a library, as well as the shared or static object library,
you also need the interface files.  That's why the
@samp{libmypackage} target builds @samp{$(mypackage.ints)} and
@samp{$(mypackage.int3s)}.
If the people using the library are going to use intermodule
optimization, you will also need the intermodule optimization interfaces.
The @samp{libmypackage} target will build @samp{$(mypackage.opts)} if
@samp{--intermodule-optimization} is specified in your @samp{MCFLAGS}
variable (this is recommended).
@findex --intermodule-optimization
Similarly, if the people using the library are going to use transitive
intermodule optimization, you will also need the transitive intermodule
optimization interfaces (@samp{$(mypackage.trans_opt)}).
These will be built if @samp{--trans-intermod-opt} is specified in your
@samp{MCFLAGS} variable.
@findex --trans-intermod-opt

In addition, with certain compilation grades, programs will need to
execute some startup code to initialize the library; the
@samp{mypackage.init} file contains information about initialization
code for the library.  The @samp{libmypackage} target will build this file.

On some platforms, shared objects must be created using position independent
code (PIC), which requires passing some special options to the C compiler.
On these platforms, @code{Mmake} will create @file{.pic_o} files,
and @samp{$(mypackage.pic_os)} will contain a list of the @file{.pic_o} files
for the library whose top-level module is @samp{mypackage}.
In addition, @samp{$(MLPICOBJS)} will be set to @samp{$MLOBJS} with
all occurrences of @samp{.o} replaced with @samp{.pic_o}.
On other platforms, position independent code is the default,
so @samp{$(mypackage.pic_os)} will just be the same as @samp{$(mypackage.os)},
which contains a list of the @file{.o} files for that module,
and @samp{$(MLPICOBJS)} will be the same as @samp{$(MLOBJS)}.

@node Installing libraries with Mmake
@subsection Installing libraries with Mmake

@samp{mmake} has support for alternative library directory hierarchies.
These have the same structure as the @file{@var{prefix}/lib/mercury} tree,
including the different subdirectories for different grades and different
machine architectures.

In order to support the installation of a library into such a tree, you
simply need to specify (e.g.@: in your @file{Mmakefile}) the path prefix
and the list of grades to install:

@example
INSTALL_PREFIX = /my/install/dir
LIBGRADES = asm_fast asm_fast.gc.tr.debug
@end example
@vindex INSTALL_PREFIX
@vindex LIBGRADES

This specifies that libraries should be installed in
@file{/my/install/dir/lib/mercury}, in the default grade plus
@samp{asm_fast} and @samp{asm_fast.gc.tr.debug}.
If @samp{INSTALL_PREFIX} is not specified, @samp{mmake} will attempt to
install the library in the same place as the standard Mercury libraries.
If @samp{LIBGRADES} is not specified, @samp{mmake} will use the Mercury
compiler's default set of grades, which may or may not correspond to the
actual set of grades in which the standard Mercury libraries were installed.

To actually install a library @samp{lib@var{foo}}, use the @samp{mmake}
target @samp{lib@var{foo}.install}.
This also installs all the needed interface files, and (if intermodule
optimisation is enabled) the relevant intermodule optimisation files.

One can override the list of grades to install for a given library
@samp{lib@var{foo}} by setting the @samp{LIBGRADES-@var{foo}} variable,
or add to it by setting @samp{EXTRA_LIBGRADES-@var{foo}}.

The command used to install each file is specified by @samp{INSTALL}.
If @samp{INSTALL} is not specified, @samp{cp} will be used.
@vindex INSTALL

The command used to create directories is specified by @samp{INSTALL_MKDIR}.
If @samp{INSTALL_MKDIR} is not specified, @samp{mkdir -p} will be used.
@vindex INSTALL_MKDIR

Note that currently it is not possible to set the installation prefix
on a library-by-library basis.

@node Using libraries with Mmake
@subsection Using libraries with Mmake
@cindex Libraries, linking with

Once a library is installed, using it is easy.
Suppose the user wishes to use the library @samp{mypackage} (installed
in the tree rooted at @samp{/some/directory/mypackage}) and the library
@samp{myotherlib} (installed in the tree rooted at
@samp{/some/directory/myotherlib}).
The user need only set the following Mmake variables:

@example
EXTRA_LIB_DIRS = /some/directory/mypackage/lib/mercury \
                /some/directory/myotherlib/lib/mercury
EXTRA_LIBRARIES = mypackage myotherlib
@end example
@vindex EXTRA_LIBRARIES
@vindex EXTRA_LIB_DIRS

@findex --intermodule-optimization
When using @samp{--intermodule-optimization} with a library which
uses the C interface, it may be necessary to add @samp{-I} options to
@samp{MGNUCFLAGS} so that the C compiler can find any header files
used by the library's C code.

Mmake will ensure that the appropriate directories are searched for
the relevant interface files, module initialisation files, compiled
libraries, etc.

Beware that the directory name that you must use in @samp{EXTRA_LIB_DIRS}
or as the argument of the @samp{--mld} option is not quite the same as
the name that was specified in the @samp{INSTALL_PREFIX} when the library
was installed --- the name needs to have @samp{/lib/mercury} appended.

One can specify extra libraries to be used on a program-by-program
basis.  For instance, if the program @samp{foo} also uses the library
@samp{mylib4foo}, but the other programs governed by the Mmakefile don't,
then one can declare:

@example
EXTRA_LIBRARIES-foo = mylib4foo
@end example

@node Libraries and the Java grade
@section Libraries and the Java grade
@cindex jar files
@cindex Java libraries

Libraries are handled a little differently for the Java grade.  Instead of
compiling object code into a static or shared library, the class files are
added to a jar (Java ARchive) file of the form @file{@var{library-name}.jar}.

To create or install a Java library, simply specify that you want to use the
java grade, either by setting @samp{GRADE=java} in your Mmakefile, or by
including @samp{--java} or @samp{--grade java} in your @samp{GRADEFLAGS}, then
follow the instructions as above.

Java libraries are installed to the directory
@file{@var{prefix}/lib/mercury/lib/java}.  To include them in a program, in
addition to the instructions above, you will need to include the installed jar
file in your @samp{CLASSPATH}, which you can set using
@samp{--java-classpath @var{jarfile}} in @samp{MCFLAGS}.

@node Libraries and the Erlang grade
@section Libraries and the Erlang grade
@cindex .beams directories
@cindex Erlang libraries

Since the Erlang implementation does not have library files, the Mercury
compiler puts all the @file{.beam} files for a single Mercury library into a
directory named @file{lib@var{library-name}.beams}.

To create or install an Erlang "library", specify that you want to use
the erlang grade and use @samp{mmc --make}.  Mmake does not, at present,
support Erlang targets.

@node Quick overview
@section Quick overview

This section gives a quick and simple guide to getting
started with the debugger.  The remainder of this chapter
contains more detailed documentation.

To use the debugger, you must
first compile your program with debugging enabled.
You can do this by using
one of the @samp{--debug} or @samp{--decl-debug} options
when invoking @samp{mmc},
or by including @samp{GRADEFLAGS = --debug}
or @samp{GRADEFLAGS = --decl-debug}
in your @file{Mmakefile}.

@findex --debug
@example
bash$ mmc --debug hello.m
@end example

Once you've compiled with debugging enabled, you can use the @samp{mdb}
command to invoke your program under the debugger:

@pindex mdb
@example
bash$ mdb ./hello arg1 arg2 @dots{}
@end example

Any arguments (such as @samp{arg1 arg2 @dots{}} in this example)
that you pass after the program name will be given as arguments
to the program.

The debugger will print a start-up message
and will then show you the first trace event,
namely the call to @code{main/2}:

@example
       1:      1  1 CALL pred hello:main/2-0 (det)
                         hello.m:13
mdb>
@end example

By hitting enter at the @samp{mdb>} prompt, you can step through
the execution of your program to the next trace event:

@example
       2:      2  2 CALL pred io:write_string/3-0 (det)
                         io.m:2837 (hello.m:14)
mdb>
Hello, world
       3:      2  2 EXIT pred io:write_string/3-0 (det)
                         io.m:2837 (hello.m:14)
mdb>

@end example

For each trace event, the debugger prints out several pieces of information.
The three numbers at the start of the display are
the event number, the call sequence number, and the call depth.
(You don't really need to pay too much attention to those.)
They are followed by the event type (e.g.@: @samp{CALL} or @samp{EXIT}).
After that comes the identification of the procedure
in which the event occurred, consisting of the module-qualified name
of the predicate or function to which the procedure belongs,
followed by its arity, mode number and determinism.
This may sometimes be followed by a ``path''
(@pxref{Tracing of Mercury programs}).
At the end is the file name and line number of the
called procedure and (if available) also the file name
and line number of the call.

The most useful @code{mdb} commands have single-letter abbreviations.
The @samp{alias} command will show these abbreviations:

@example
mdb> alias
?      =>    help
EMPTY  =>    step
NUMBER =>    step
P      =>    print *
b      =>    break
c      =>    continue
d      =>    stack
f      =>    finish
g      =>    goto
h      =>    help
p      =>    print
r      =>    retry
s      =>    step
v      =>    vars
@end example

The @samp{P} or @samp{print *} command will display the values
of any live variables in scope.
The @samp{f} or @samp{finish} command can be used if you want
to skip over a call.
The @samp{b} or @samp{break} command can be used to set breakpoints.
The @samp{d} or @samp{stack} command will display the call stack.
The @samp{quit} command will exit the debugger.

That should be enough to get you started.
But if you have GNU Emacs installed, you should strongly
consider using the Emacs interface to @samp{mdb} --- see
the following section.

For more information about the available commands,
use the @samp{?} or @samp{help} command, or see @ref{Debugger commands}.

@node GNU Emacs interface
@section GNU Emacs interface
@cindex GNU Emacs
@cindex Emacs

As well as the command-line debugger, mdb, there is also an Emacs
interface to this debugger.  Note that the Emacs interface only
works with GNU Emacs, not with XEmacs.

With the Emacs interface, the debugger will display your source code
as you trace through it, marking the line that is currently being
executed, and allowing you to easily set breakpoints on particular
lines in your source code.  You can have separate windows for
the debugger prompt, the source code being executed, and for
the output of the program being executed.
In addition, most of the mdb commands are accessible via menus.

To start the Emacs interface, you first need to put the following
text in the file @file{.emacs} in your home directory,
replacing ``/usr/local/mercury-1.0'' with the directory
that your Mercury implementation was installed in.

@example
(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name
  "/usr/local/mercury-1.0/lib/mercury/elisp")
  load-path))
(autoload 'mdb "gud" "Invoke the Mercury debugger" t)
@end example

Build your program with debugging enabled, as described
in @ref{Quick overview} or @ref{Preparing a program for debugging}.
Then start up Emacs, e.g.@: using the command @samp{emacs},
and type @kbd{M-x mdb @key{RET}}. Emacs will then prompt you for
the mdb command to invoke

@example
Run mdb (like this): mdb
@end example

@noindent
and you should type in the name of the program that you want to debug
and any arguments that you want to pass to it:

@example
Run mdb (like this): mdb ./hello arg1 arg2 @dots{}
@end example

Emacs will then create several ``buffers'': one for the debugger prompt,
one for the input and output of the program being executed, and one or more
for the source files.  By default, Emacs will split the display into two
parts, called ``windows'', so that two of these buffers will be visible.
You can use the command @kbd{C-x o} to switch between windows,
and you can use the command @kbd{C-x 2} to split a window into two
windows.  You can use the ``Buffers'' menu to select which buffer is
displayed in each window.

If you're using X-Windows, then it is a good idea
to set the Emacs variable @samp{pop-up-frames} to @samp{t}
before starting mdb, since this will cause each buffer to be
displayed in a new ``frame'' (i.e.@: a new X window).
You can set this variable interactively using the
@samp{set-variable} command, i.e.@:
@kbd{M-x set-variable @key{RET} pop-up-frames @key{RET} t @key{RET}}.
Or you can put @samp{(setq pop-up-frames t)} in the @file{.emacs}
file in your home directory.

For more information on buffers, windows, and frames,
see the Emacs documentation.

Another useful Emacs variable is @samp{gud-mdb-directories}.
This specifies the list of directories to search for source files.
You can use a command such as

@example
M-x set-variable @key{RET}
gud-mdb-directories @key{RET}
(list "/foo/bar" "../other" "/home/guest") @key{RET}
@end example

@noindent
to set it interactively, or you can put a command like

@example
(setq gud-mdb-directories
  (list "/foo/bar" "../other" "/home/guest"))
@end example

@noindent
in your @file{.emacs} file.

At each trace event, the debugger will search for the
source file corresponding to that event, first in the
same directory as the program, and then in the directories
specified by the @samp{gud-mdb-directories} variable.
It will display the source file, with the line number
corresponding to that trace event marked by
an arrow (@samp{=>}) at the start of the line.

Several of the debugger features can be accessed by moving
the cursor to the relevant part of the source code and then
selecting a command from the menu.
You can set a break point on a line by moving the cursor to the
appropriate line in your source code (e.g.@: with the arrow keys,
or by clicking the mouse there), and then selecting
the ``Set breakpoint on line'' command from the ``Breakpoints''
sub-menu of the ``MDB'' menu.  You can set a breakpoint on
a procedure by moving the cursor over the procedure name
and then selecting the ``Set breakpoint on procedure''
command from the same menu.  And you can display the value of
a variable by moving the cursor over the variable name
and then selecting the ``Print variable'' command from the
``Data browsing'' sub-menu of the ``MDB'' menu.
Most of the menu commands also have keyboard short-cuts,
which are displayed on the menu.

Note that @samp{mdb}'s @samp{context} and @samp{user_event_context} commands
should not be used if you are using the Emacs interface, otherwise the Emacs
interface won't be able to parse the file names and line numbers that
@samp{mdb} outputs, and so it won't be able to highlight the correct location
in the source code.

@node Tracing of Mercury programs
@section Tracing of Mercury programs
@cindex Tracing

The Mercury debugger is based on a modified version of the box model
on which the four-port debuggers of most Prolog systems are based.
Such debuggers abstract the execution of a program into a sequence,
also called a @dfn{trace}, of execution events of various kinds.
The four kinds of events supported by most Prolog systems (their @emph{ports})
are

@cindex debugger trace events
@cindex trace events
@cindex call (trace event)
@cindex exit (trace event)
@cindex redo (trace event)
@cindex fail (trace event)
@table @emph
@item call
A call event occurs just after a procedure has been called,
and control has just reached the start of the body of the procedure.
@item exit
An exit event occurs when a procedure call has succeeded,
and control is about to return to its caller.
@item redo
A redo event occurs when all computations
to the right of a procedure call have failed,
and control is about to return to this call
to try to find alternative solutions.
@item fail
A fail event occurs when a procedure call has run out of alternatives,
and control is about to return to the rightmost computation to its left
that still has possibly successful alternatives left.
@end table

Mercury also supports these four kinds of events,
but not all events can occur for every procedure call.
Which events can occur for a procedure call, and in what order,
depend on the determinism of the procedure.
The possible event sequences for procedures of the various determinisms
are as follows.

@table @emph
@item nondet procedures
a call event, zero or more repeats of (exit event, redo event), and a fail event
@item multi procedures
a call event, one or more repeats of (exit event, redo event), and a fail event
@item semidet and cc_nondet procedures
a call event, and either an exit event or a fail event
@item det and cc_multi procedures
a call event and an exit event
@item failure procedures
a call event and a fail event
@item erroneous procedures
a call event
@end table

In addition to these four event types,
Mercury supports @emph{exception} events.
An exception event occurs
when an exception has been thrown inside a procedure,
and control is about to propagate this exception to the caller.
An exception event can replace the final exit or fail event
in the event sequences above
or, in the case of erroneous procedures,
can come after the call event.

Besides the event types call, exit, redo, fail and exception,
which describe the @emph{interface} of a call,
Mercury also supports several types of events
that report on what is happening @emph{internal} to a call.
Each of these internal event types has an associated parameter called a path.
The internal event types are:

@cindex cond (trace event)
@cindex then (trace event)
@cindex else (trace event)
@cindex disj (trace event)
@cindex switch (trace event)
@cindex neg_enter (trace event)
@cindex neg_fail (trace event)
@cindex neg_success (trace event)
@table @emph
@item cond
A cond event occurs when execution reaches
the start of the condition of an if-then-else.
The path associated with the event specifies which if-then-else this is.
@item then
A then event occurs when execution reaches
the start of the then part of an if-then-else.
The path associated with the event specifies which if-then-else this is.
@item else
An else event occurs when execution reaches
the start of the else part of an if-then-else.
The path associated with the event specifies which if-then-else this is.
@item disj
A disj event occurs when execution reaches
the start of a disjunct in a disjunction.
The path associated with the event specifies
which disjunct of which disjunction this is.
@item switch
A switch event occurs when execution reaches
the start of one arm of a switch
(a disjunction in which each disjunct unifies a bound variable
with different function symbol).
The path associated with the event specifies
which arm of which switch this is.
@item neg_enter
A neg_enter event occurs when execution reaches
the start of a negated goal.
The path associated with the event specifies which negation goal this is.
@item neg_fail
A neg_fail event occurs when
a goal inside a negation succeeds,
which means that its negation fails.
The path associated with the event specifies which negation goal this is.
@item neg_success
A neg_success event occurs when
a goal inside a negation fails,
which means that its negation succeeds.
The path associated with the event specifies which negation goal this is.
@c @item pragma_first
@c @item pragma_later
@end table

@cindex path
@cindex goal path
A goal path is a sequence of path components separated by semicolons.
Each path component is one of the following:

@table @code
@item c@var{num}
The @var{num}'th conjunct of a conjunction.
@item d@var{num}
The @var{num}'th disjunct of a disjunction.
@item s@var{num}
The @var{num}'th arm of a switch.
@item ?
The condition of an if-then-else.
@item t
The then part of an if-then-else.
@item e
The else part of an if-then-else.
@item ~
The goal inside a negation.
@item q!
The goal inside an existential quantification or other scope
that changes the determinism of the goal.
@item q
The goal inside an existential quantification or other scope
that doesn't change the determinism of the goal.
@end table

A goal path describes the position of a goal
inside the body of a procedure definition.
For example, if the procedure body is a disjunction
in which each disjunct is a conjunction,
then the goal path @samp{d2;c3;} denotes
the third conjunct within the second disjunct.
If the third conjunct within the second disjunct is an atomic goal
such as a call or a unification,
then this will be the only goal with whose path has @samp{d2;c3;} as a prefix.
If it is a compound goal,
then its components will all have paths that have @samp{d2;c3;} as a prefix,
e.g.@: if it is an if-then-else,
then its three components will have the paths
@samp{d2;c3;?;}, @samp{d2;c3;t;} and @samp{d2;c3;e;}.

Goal paths refer to the internal form of the procedure definition.
When debugging is enabled
(and the option @samp{--trace-optimized} is not given),
the compiler will try to keep this form
as close as possible to the source form of the procedure,
in order to make event paths as useful as possible to the programmer.
Due to the compiler's flattening of terms,
and its introduction of extra unifications to implement calls in implied modes,
the number of conjuncts in a conjunction will frequently differ
between the source and internal form of a procedure.
This is rarely a problem, however, as long as you know about it.
Mode reordering can be a bit more of a problem,
but it can be avoided by writing single-mode predicates and functions
so that producers come before consumers.
The compiler transformation that
potentially causes the most trouble in the interpretation of goal paths
is the conversion of disjunctions into switches.
In most cases, a disjunction is transformed into a single switch,
and it is usually easy to guess, just from the events within a switch arm,
just which disjunct the switch arm corresponds to.
Some cases are more complex;
for example, it is possible for a single disjunction
to be transformed into several switches,
possibly with other, smaller disjunctions inside them.
In such cases, making sense of goal paths
may require a look at the internal form of the procedure.
You can ask the compiler to generate a file
with the internal forms of the procedures in a given module
by including the options @samp{-dfinal -Dpaths} on the command line
when compiling that module.

@node Preparing a program for debugging
@section Preparing a program for debugging

When you compile a Mercury program, you can specify
whether you want to be able to run the Mercury debugger on the program or not.
If you do, the compiler embeds calls to the Mercury debugging system
into the executable code of the program,
at the execution points that represent trace events.
At each event, the debugging system decides
whether to give control back to the executable immediately,
or whether to first give control to you,
allowing you to examine the state of the computation and issue commands.

Mercury supports two broad ways of preparing a program for debugging.
The simpler way is to compile a program in a debugging grade,
which you can do directly by specifying a grade
that includes the word ``debug'' or ``decldebug''
(e.g.@: @samp{asm_fast.gc.debug}, or @samp{asm_fast.gc.decldebug}),
or indirectly by specifying one of the @samp{--debug} or @samp{--decl-debug}
grade options to the compiler, linker, and other tools
(in particular @code{mmc}, @code{mgnuc}, @code{ml}, and @code{c2init}).
If you follow this way,
and accept the default settings of the various compiler options
that control the selection of trace events (which are described below),
you will be assured of being able to get control
at every execution point that represents a potential trace event,
which is very convenient.

The ``decldebug'' grades improve declarative debugging by allowing the user
to track the source of subterms (see @ref{Improving the search}).
Doing this increases the size of executables,
so these grades should only be used when you need
the subterm dependency tracking feature of the declarative debugger.
Note that declarative debugging,
with the exception of the subterm dependency tracking features,
also works in the .debug grades.

@c XXX mention ssdebug grades when ready

The two drawbacks of using a debugging grade
are the large size of the resulting executables,
and the fact that often you discover that you need to debug a big program
only after having built it in a non-debugging grade.
This is why Mercury also supports another way
to prepare a program for debugging,
one that does not require the use of a debugging grade.
With this way, you can decide, individually for each module,
which of four trace levels,
@samp{none}, @samp{shallow}, @samp{deep}, and @samp{rep}
you want to compile them with:

@cindex debugger trace level
@cindex trace level
@cindex shallow tracing
@cindex deep tracing
@table @samp
@item none
A procedure compiled with trace level @samp{none}
will never generate any events.
@item deep
A procedure compiled with trace level @samp{deep}
will always generate all the events requested by the user.
By default, this is all possible events,
but you can tell the compiler that
you are not interested in some kinds of events
via compiler options (see below).
However, declarative debugging requires all events to be generated
if it is to operate properly,
so do not disable the generation of any event types
if you want to use declarative debugging.
For more details see @ref{Declarative debugging}.
@item rep
This trace level is the same as trace level @samp{deep},
except that a representation of the module is stored in the executable
along with the usual debugging information.
The declarative debugger can use this extra information
to help it avoid asking unnecessary questions,
so this trace level has the effect of better declarative debugging
at the cost of increased executable size.
For more details see @ref{Declarative debugging}.
@item shallow
A procedure compiled with trace level @samp{shallow}
will generate interface events
if it is called from a procedure compiled with trace level @samp{deep},
but it will never generate any internal events,
and it will not generate any interface events either
if it is called from a procedure compiled with trace level @samp{shallow}.
If it is called from a procedure compiled with trace level @samp{none},
the way it will behave is dictated by whether
its nearest ancestor whose trace level is not @samp{none}
has trace level @samp{deep} or @samp{shallow}.
@end table

The intended uses of these trace levels are as follows.

@table @samp
@item deep
You should compile a module with trace level @samp{deep}
if you suspect there may be a bug in the module,
or if you think that being able to examine what happens inside that module
can help you locate a bug.
@item rep
You should compile a module with trace level @samp{rep}
if you suspect there may be a bug in the module,
you wish to use the full power of the declarative debugger,
and you are not concerned about the size of the executable.
@item shallow
You should compile a module with trace level @samp{shallow}
if you believe the code of the module is reliable and unlikely to have bugs,
but you still want to be able to get control at calls to and returns from
any predicates and functions defined in the module,
and if you want to be able to see the arguments of those calls.
@item none
You should compile a module with trace level @samp{none}
only if you are reasonably confident that the module is reliable,
and if you believe that knowing what calls other modules make to this module
would not significantly benefit you in your debugging.
@end table

In general, it is a good idea for most or all modules
that can be called from modules compiled with trace level
@samp{deep} or @samp{rep}
to be compiled with at least trace level @samp{shallow}.

You can control what trace level a module is compiled with
by giving one of the following compiler options:

@table @samp
@item --trace shallow
This always sets the trace level to @samp{shallow}.
@item --trace deep
This always sets the trace level to @samp{deep}.
@item --trace rep
This always sets the trace level to @samp{rep}.
@item --trace minimum
In debugging grades, this sets the trace level to @samp{shallow};
in non-debugging grades, it sets the trace level to @samp{none}.
@item --trace default
In debugging grades, this sets the trace level to @samp{deep};
in non-debugging grades, it sets the trace level to @samp{none}.
@end table

As the name implies, the last alternative is the default,
which is why by default you get
no debugging capability in non-debugging grades
and full debugging capability in debugging grades.
The table also shows that in a debugging grade,
no module can be compiled with trace level @samp{none}.

@strong{Important note}:
If you are not using a debugging grade, but you compile some modules with
a trace level other than none,
then you must also pass the @samp{--trace} (or @samp{-t}) option
to c2init and to the Mercury linker.
If you're using Mmake, then you can do this by including @samp{--trace}
in the @samp{MLFLAGS} variable.

If you're using Mmake, then you can also set the compilation options
for a single module named @var{Module} by setting the Mmake variable
@samp{MCFLAGS-@var{Module}}.  For example, to compile the file
@file{foo.m} with deep tracing, @file{bar.m} with shallow tracing,
and everything else with no tracing, you could use the following:

@example
MLFLAGS     = --trace
MCFLAGS-foo = --trace deep
MCFLAGS-bar = --trace shallow
@end example

@node Tracing optimized code
@section Tracing optimized code

@c XXX we should consider where to document --suppress-trace
@c and --stack-trace-higher-order

By default, all trace levels other than @samp{none}
turn off all compiler optimizations
that can affect the sequence of trace events generated by the program,
such as inlining.
If you are specifically interested in
how the compiler's optimizations affect the trace event sequence,
you can specify the option @samp{--trace-optimized},
which tells the compiler that it does not have to disable those optimizations.
(A small number of low-level optimizations
have not yet been enhanced to work properly in the presence of tracing,
so the compiler disables these even if @samp{--trace-optimized} is given.)

@node Mercury debugger invocation
@section Mercury debugger invocation

The executables of Mercury programs
by default do not invoke the Mercury debugger
even if some or all of their modules were compiled with some form of tracing,
and even if the grade of the executable is a debugging grade.
This is similar to the behaviour of executables
created by the implementations of other languages;
for example the executable of a C program compiled with @samp{-g}
does not automatically invoke gdb or dbx etc when it is executed.

Unlike those other language implementations,
when you invoke the Mercury debugger @samp{mdb},
you invoke it not just with the name of an executable
but with the command line you want to debug.
If something goes wrong when you execute the command

@example
@var{prog} @var{arg1} @var{arg2} @dots{}
@end example

and you want to find the cause of the problem,
you must execute the command

@example
mdb [@var{mdb-options}] @var{prog} @var{arg1} @var{arg2} @dots{}
@end example

because you do not get a chance
to specify the command line of the program later.

When the debugger starts up, as part of its initialization
it executes commands from the following three sources, in order:
@enumerate
@item
@vindex MERCURY_DEBUGGER_INIT
The file named by the @env{MERCURY_DEBUGGER_INIT} environment variable.
Usually, @samp{mdb} sets this variable to point to a file
that provides documentation for all the debugger commands
and defines a small set of aliases.
However, if @env{MERCURY_DEBUGGER_INIT} is already defined
when @samp{mdb} is invoked, it will leave its value unchanged.
You can use this override ability to provide alternate documentation.
If the file named by @env{MERCURY_DEBUGGER_INIT} cannot be read,
@samp{mdb} will print a warning,
since in that case, that usual online documentation will not be available.
@item
@cindex mdbrc
@cindex .mdbrc
The file named @file{.mdbrc} in your home directory.
You can put your usual aliases and settings here.
@item
The file named @file{.mdbrc} in the current working directory.
You can put program-specific aliases and settings here.
@end enumerate
mdb will ignore any lines starting with the character @samp{#}
in any of the above mentioned files.

mdb accepts the following options from the command line.  The options
should be given to mdb before the name of the executable to be debugged.

@table @code
@item -t @var{file-name}, --tty @var{file-name}
@findex --tty (mdb option)
Redirect all of the I/O for the debugger to the device
specified by @var{file-name}.
The I/O for the program being debugged will not be redirected.
This option allows the contents of a file to be piped to the program being
debugged and not to mdb.
For example, on Linux the command
@example
mdb -t /dev/tty ./myprog < myinput
@end example
will cause the contents of @file{myinput} to be piped to the program
@samp{myprog}, but mdb will read its input from the terminal.
@sp 1
@item -w, --window, --mdb-in-window
@findex --mdb-in-window (mdb option)
@findex --window (mdb option)
Run mdb in a new window, with mdb's I/O going to that
window, but with the program's I/O going to the current
terminal.  Note that this will not work on all systems.
@sp 1
@item --program-in-window
@findex --program-in-window (mdb option)
Run the program in a new window, with the program's I/O
going to that window, but with mdb's I/O going to the
current terminal.  Note that input and output redirection
will not work with the @samp{--program-in-window} option.
@samp{--program-in-window} will work on most Unix systems
running the X Window System, even those for which
@samp{--mdb-in-window} is not supported.
@sp 1
@item -c @var{window-command}, --window-command @var{window-command}
@findex --window-command (mdb option)
Specify the command used by the @samp{--program-in-window}
option for executing a command in a new window.
The default such command is @samp{xterm -e}.
@end table

@node Mercury debugger concepts
@section Mercury debugger concepts

The operation of the Mercury debugger @samp{mdb}
is based on the following concepts.

@table @emph
@item break points
@cindex debugger break points
@cindex break points
@cindex spy points
The user may associate a break point
with some events that occur inside a procedure;
the invocation condition of the break point says which events these are.
The four possible invocation conditions (also called scopes) are:
@sp 1
@itemize @bullet
@item
the call event,
@item
all interface events,
@item
all events, and
@item
the event at a specific point in the procedure.
@end itemize
@sp 1
The effect of a break point depends on the state of the break point.
@sp 1
@itemize @bullet
@item
If the state of the break point is @samp{stop},
execution will stop and user interaction will start
at any event within the procedure that matches the invocation conditions,
unless the current debugger command has specifically disabled this behaviour
(see the concept @samp{strict commands} below).
@sp 1
@item
If the state of the break point is @samp{print},
the debugger will print any event within the procedure
that matches the invocation conditions,
unless the current debugger command has specifically disabled this behaviour
(see the concept @samp{print level} below).
@end itemize
@sp 1
Neither of these will happen if the break point is disabled.
@sp 1
Every break point has a print list.
Every time execution stops at an event that matches the breakpoint,
mdb implicitly executes a print command for each element
in the breakpoint's print list.
A print list element can be the word @samp{goal},
which causes the goal to the printed as if by @samp{print goal};
it can be the word @samp{*},
which causes all the variables to the printed as if by @samp{print *};
or it can be the name or number of a variable,
possibly followed (without white space) by a term path,
which causes the specified variable or part thereof to the printed
as if the element were given as an argument to the @samp{print} command.
@sp 1
@item strict commands
@cindex strict debugger commands
When a debugger command steps over some events
without user interaction at those events,
the @emph{strictness} of the command controls whether
the debugger will stop execution and resume user interaction
at events to which a break point with state @samp{stop} applies.
By default, the debugger will stop at such events.
However, if the debugger is executing a strict command,
it will not stop at an event
just because a break point in the stop state applies to it.

@cindex debugger interrupt
@cindex interrupt, in debugger
@cindex control-C
If the debugger receives an interrupt (e.g.@: if the user presses control-C),
it will stop at the next event regardless of what command it is executing
at the time.
@sp 1
@item print level
@cindex print level
@cindex debugger print level
When a debugger command steps over some events
without user interaction at those events,
the @emph{print level} controls under what circumstances
the stepped over events will be printed.
@sp 1
@itemize @bullet
@item
When the print level is @samp{none},
none of the stepped over events will be printed.
@sp 1
@item
When the print level is @samp{all},
all the stepped over events will be printed.
@sp 1
@item
When the print level is @samp{some},
the debugger will print the event only if a break point applies to the event.
@end itemize
@sp 1
Regardless of the print level, the debugger will print
any event that causes execution to stop and user interaction to start.
@sp 1
@item default print level
The debugger maintains a default print level.
The initial value of this variable is @samp{some},
but this value can be overridden by the user.
@sp 1
@item current environment
Whenever execution stops at an event, the current environment
is reset to refer to the stack frame of the call specified by the event.
However, the @samp{up}, @samp{down} and @samp{level} commands
can set the current environment
to refer to one of the ancestors of the current call.
This will then be the current environment until another of these commands
changes the environment yet again or execution continues to another event.
@sp 1
@item paths in terms
@cindex paths in terms
@cindex term navigation
When browsing or printing a term,
you can use "^@samp{n}" to refer to the @var{n}th subterm of that term.
If the term's type has named fields,
you can use "^@samp{fname}" to refer to
the subterm of the field named @samp{fname}.
You can use several of these subterm specifications in a row
to refer to subterms deep within the original term.
For example, when applied to a list,
"^2" refers to the tail of the list
(the second argument of the list constructor),
"^2^2" refers to the tail of the tail of the list,
and "^2^2^1" refers to the head of the tail of the tail,
i.e. to the third element of the list.
You can think of terms as Unix directories,
with constants (function symbols of arity zero) being plain files
and function symbols of arity greater than zero being directories themselves.
Each subterm specification such as "^2" goes one level down in the hierarchy.
The exception is the subterm specification "^..",
which goes one level up, to the parent of the current directory.

@node User defined events
@section User defined events

Besides the builtin set of events,
the Mercury debugger also supports events defined by the user.
The intention is that users can define one kind of event
for each semantically important event in the program
that isn't captured by the standard builtin events,
and can then generate those events at the appropriate point in the source code.
Each event appears in the source code
as a call prefixed by the keyword @samp{event},
with each argument of the call giving the value of an event @emph{attribute}.

Users can specify the set of user defined events that can appear in a program,
and the names, types and order of the attributes
of each kind of user defined event,
by giving the name of an event set specification file to the compiler
when compiling that program
as the argument of the @samp{event-set-file-name} option.
This file should contain a header giving the event set's name,
followed by a sequence of one or more event specifications,
like this:

@c XXX replace with more realistic example
@example
    event set queens

    event nodiag_fail(
        test_failed:    string,
        arg_b:          int,
        arg_d:          int,
        arg_list_len:   int synthesized by list_len_func(sorted_list),
        sorted_list:    list(int) synthesized by list_sort_func(arg_list),
        list_len_func:  function,
        list_sort_func: function,
        arg_list:       list(int)
    )

    event safe_test(
        test_list:      listint
    )

    event noargs
@end example

The header consists of the keywords @samp{event set}
and an identifier giving the event set name.
Each event specification consists of the keyword @samp{event},
the name of the event, and,
if the event has any attributes, a parenthesized list of those attributes.
Each attribute's specification consists of
a name, a colon and information about the attribute.

There are three kinds of attributes.
@itemize
@item
For ordinary attributes, like @samp{arg_b},
the information about the attribute is the Mercury type of that attribute.
@item
For function attributes, like @samp{list_sort_func},
the information about the attribute is just the keyword @samp{function}.
@item
For synthesized attributes, like @samp{sorted_list},
the information about the attribute is the type of the attribute,
the keywords @samp{synthesized by},
and a description of the Mercury function call
required to synthesize the value of the attribute.
The synthesis call consists of the name of a function attribute
and a list of the names of one or more argument attributes.
Argument attributes cannot be function attributes;
they may be either ordinary attributes, or previously synthesized attributes.
A synthesized attribute is not allowed
to depend on itself directly or indirectly,
but there are no restrictions on the positions of synthesized attributes
compared to the positions of the function attributes computing them
or of the argument attributes of the synthesis functions.
@end itemize

The result types of function attributes
are given by the types of the synthesized attributes they compute.
The argument types of function attributes (and the number of those arguments)
are given by the types of the arguments they are applied to.
Each function attribute must be used
to compute at least one synthesized attribute,
otherwise there would be no way to compute its type.
If it is used to compute more than one synthesized attribute,
the result and argument types must be consistent.

Each event goal in the program must use
the name of one of the events defined here as the predicate name of the call,
and the call's arguments must match
the types of that event's non-synthesized attributes.
Given that B and N are integers and L is a list of integers,
these event goals are fine,
@example
	event nodiag_fail("N - B", B, N, list.length, list.sort, [N | L]),
	event safe_test([1, 2, 3])
@end example
but these goals
@example
	event nodiag_fail("N - B", B, N, list.sort, list.length, [N | L]),
	event nodiag_fail("N - B", B, list.length, N, list.sort, [N | L]),
	event safe_test([1], [2])
	event safe_test(42)
	event nonexistent_event(42)
@end example
will all generate errors.

The attributes of event calls are always input,
and the event goal is always @samp{det}.

@node I/O tabling
@section I/O tabling

In Mercury, predicates that want to do I/O
must take a di/uo pair of I/O state arguments.
Some of these predicates call other predicates to do I/O for them,
but some are @emph{I/O primitives}, i.e. they perform the I/O themselves.
The Mercury standard library provides a large set of these primitives,
and programmers can write their own through the foreign language interface.
An I/O action is the execution of one call to an I/O primitive.

In debugging grades, the Mercury implementation has the ability
to automatically record, for every I/O action,
the identity of the I/O primitive involved in the action
and the values of all its arguments.
The size of the table storing this information
is proportional to the number of @emph{tabled} I/O actions,
which are the I/O actions whose details are entered into the table.
Therefore the tabling of I/O actions is never turned on automatically;
instead, users must ask for I/O tabling to start
with the @samp{table_io start} command in mdb.

The purpose of I/O tabling is to enable transparent retries across I/O actions.
(The mdb @samp{retry} command
restores the computation to a state it had earlier,
allowing the programmer to explore code that the program has already executed;
see its documentation in the @ref{Debugger commands} section below.)
In the absence of I/O tabling,
retries across I/O actions can have bad consequences.
Retry of a goal that reads some input requires that input to be provided twice;
retry of a goal that writes some output generates duplicate output.
Retry of a goal that opens a file leads to a file descriptor leak;
retry of a goal that closes a file can lead to errors
(duplicate closes, reads from and writes to closed files).

I/O tabling avoids these problems by making I/O primitives @emph{idempotent}.
This means that they will generate their desired effect
when they are first executed,
but reexecuting them after a retry won't have any further effect.
The Mercury implementation achieves this
by looking up the action (which is identified by a I/O action number)
in the table and returning the output arguments stored in the table
for the given action @emph{without} executing the code of the primitive.

Starting I/O tabling when the program starts execution
and leaving it enabled for the entire program run
will work well for program runs that don't do lots of I/O.
For program runs that @emph{do} lots of I/O,
the table can fill up all available memory.
In such cases, the programmer may enable I/O tabling with @samp{table_io start}
just before the program enters the part they wish to debug
and in which they wish to be able to perform
transparent retries across I/O actions,
and turn it off with @samp{table_io stop} after execution leaves that part.

The commands @samp{table_io start} and @samp{table_io stop}
can each be given only once during an mdb session.
They divide the execution of the program into three phases:
before @samp{table_io start},
between @samp{table_io start} and @samp{table_io stop},
and after @samp{table_io stop}.
Retries across I/O will be transparent only in the middle phase.

@node Debugger commands
@section Debugger commands

When the debugger (as opposed to the program being debugged) is interacting
with the user, the debugger prints a prompt and reads in a line of text,
which it will interpret as its next command line.
A command line consists of a single command,
or several commands separated by semicolons.
Each command consists of several words separated by white space.
The first word is the name of the command,
while any other words give options and/or parameters to the command.

A word may itself contain semicolons or whitespace if it is
enclosed in single quotes (@samp{'}).
This is useful for commands that have other commands as parameters,
for example @w{@samp{view -w 'xterm -e'}}.
Characters that have special meaning to @samp{mdb} will be treated like
ordinary characters if they are escaped with a backslash (@samp{\}).
It is possible to escape single quotes, whitespace, semicolons, newlines
and the escape character itself.

Some commands take a number as their first parameter.
For such commands, users can type `@var{number} @var{command}'
as well as `@var{command} @var{number}'.
The debugger will treat the former as the latter,
even if the number and the command are not separated by white space.

@subsection Interactive query commands

@table @code
@item query @var{module1} @var{module2} @dots{}
@itemx cc_query @var{module1} @var{module2} @dots{}
@itemx io_query @var{module1} @var{module2} @dots{}
@kindex query (mdb command)
@kindex cc_query (mdb command)
@kindex io_query (mdb command)

@c This documentation has been duplicated in
@c Opium-M/source/interactive_queries.op so please tell me (jahier@irisa.fr)
@c to update my documentation on interactive queries if you update this
@c subsection.

These commands allow you to type in queries (goals) interactively
in the debugger.  When you use one of these commands, the debugger
will respond with a query prompt (@samp{?-} or @samp{run <--}),
at which you can type in a goal; the debugger will then compile
and execute the goal and display the answer(s).
You can return from the query prompt to the @samp{mdb>} prompt
by typing the end-of-file indicator (typically control-D or control-Z),
or by typing @samp{quit.}.
@sp 1
The module names @var{module1}, @var{module2}, @dots{} specify
which modules will be imported.  Note that you can also
add new modules to the list of imports directly at the query prompt,
by using a command of the form @samp{[@var{module}]}, e.g.@: @samp{[int]}.
You need to import all the modules that define symbols used in your query.
Queries can only use symbols that are exported from a module;
entities which are declared in a module's implementation section
only cannot be used.
@sp 1
The three variants differ in what kind of goals they allow.
For goals which perform I/O, you need to use @samp{io_query};
this lets you type in the goal using DCG syntax.
For goals which don't do I/O, but which have determinism
@samp{cc_nondet} or @samp{cc_multi}, you need to use @samp{cc_query};
this finds only one solution to the specified goal.
For all other goals, you can use plain @samp{query}, which
finds all the solutions to the goal.
@sp 1
Goals can refer to variables in the current environment,
which will be treated as inputs to the query.
Any variables in the goal that do not exist in the current environment,
and that do not start with an underscore, will be treated as outputs.
For @samp{query} and @samp{cc_query}, the debugger will print
the bindings of output variables in the goal using @samp{io.write_cc}.
The goal must bind all of its output variables to ground terms,
otherwise you will get a mode error.
@sp 1
The current implementation works by compiling the queries on-the-fly
and then dynamically linking them into the program being debugged.
Thus it may take a little while for your query to be executed.
Each query will be written to a file named @file{mdb_query.m} in the current
directory, so make sure you don't name your source file @file{mdb_query.m}.
Note that dynamic linking may not be supported on some systems;
if you are using a system for which dynamic linking is not supported,
you will get an error message when you try to run these commands.
@sp 1
You may also need to build your program using shared libraries
for interactive queries to work.
See @ref{Libraries} for details of how to build with shared libraries.

type `io.state' (there can be only one io.state at any given time).
@sp 1
Retries over I/O actions are guaranteed to be safe
only if the events at which the retry starts and ends
are both within the I/O tabled region of the program's execution.
If the retry is not guaranteed to be safe,
the debugger will normally ask the user if they really want to do this.
The option @samp{-f} or @samp{--force} suppresses the question,
telling the debugger that retrying over I/O is OK;
the option @samp{-o} or @samp{--only-if-safe} suppresses the question,
telling the debugger that retrying over I/O is not OK;
the option @samp{-i} or @samp{--interactive} restores the question
if a previous option suppressed it.
@c The --assume-all-io-is-tabled option is for developers only. Specifying it
@c makes an assertion, and if the assertion is incorrect, the resulting
@c behaviour would be hard for non-developers to understand. The option is

@c The debugger can perform a retry only from an exit or fail port;
@c only at these ports does the debugger have enough information
@c to figure out how to reset the stacks.
@c If the debugger is not at such a port when a retry command is given,
@c the debugger will continue forward execution
@c until it reaches an exit or fail port of the call to be retried
@c before it performs the retry.
@c This may require a noticeable amount of time,

@item stack [-a] [-d] [-c@var{cliquelines}] [-f@var{numframes}] [@var{numlines}]
@kindex stack (mdb command)
Prints the names of the ancestors of the call
specified by the current event.
If two or more consecutive ancestor calls are for the same procedure,
the procedure identification will be printed once
with the appropriate multiplicity annotation.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-d} or @samp{--detailed}
specifies that for each ancestor call,
the call's event number, sequence number and depth should also be printed
if the call is to a procedure that is being execution traced.
@sp 1
If the @samp{-f} option, if present, specifies that
only the topmost @var{numframes} stack frames should be printed.
@sp 1
The optional number @var{numlines}, if present,
specifies that only the topmost @var{numlines} lines should be printed.
The default value is 100;
the special value 0 asks for all the lines to be printed.
@sp 1
By default, this command will look for cliques of mutually recursive ancestors.
It will identify them as such in the output,
and it will print at most 10 lines from any clique.
The @samp{-c} option can be used to specify
the maximum number of lines to print for a clique,
with the special value 0 asking for all of them to be printed.
The option @samp{-a} asks for all lines to be printed
@emph{without} cliques being detected or marked.
@sp 1
This command will report an error if there is no stack trace
information available about any ancestor.
@sp 1
@item up [-d] [@var{num}]
@kindex up (mdb command)
Sets the current environment to the stack frame
of the @var{num}'th level ancestor of the current environment
(the immediate caller is the first-level ancestor).
@sp 1
If @var{num} is not specified, the default value is one.
@sp 1
This command will report an error
if the current environment doesn't have the required number of ancestors,
or if there is no execution trace information about the requested ancestor,
or if there is no stack trace information about any of the ancestors
between the current environment and the requested ancestor.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-d} or @samp{--detailed}
specifies that for each ancestor call,
the call's event number, sequence number and depth should also be printed
if the call is to a procedure that is being execution traced.
@sp 1
@item down [-d] [@var{num}]
@kindex down (mdb command)
Sets the current environment to the stack frame
of the @var{num}'th level descendant of the current environment
(the procedure called by the current environment
is the first-level descendant).
@sp 1
If @var{num} is not specified, the default value is one.
@sp 1
This command will report an error
if there is no execution trace information about the requested descendant.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-d} or @samp{--detailed}
specifies that for each ancestor call,
the call's event number, sequence number and depth should also be printed
if the call is to a procedure that is being execution traced.
@sp 1
@item level [-d]
@item level [-d] @var{num}
@item level [-d] (@samp{clentry}|@samp{clique})
@item level [-d] @samp{clparent}
@kindex level (mdb command)
If the command is given no arguments,
it sets the current environment
to the stack frame that belongs to the current event.
If invoked with the number @var{num} as argument,
it sets the current environment
to the stack frame of the @var{num}'th level ancestor
of the call to which the current event belongs.
If invoked with the argument @samp{clentry} or @samp{clique},
it sets the current environment to the stack frame of the call
that first entered into the clique of recursive calls
of which the current call is a part.
(If the current call is not (mutually) recursive
with any other currently active call,
it sets the current environment to the stack frame of the current event.)
If the command is given the argument @samp{clparent},
it sets the current environment to the stack frame of the first call
outside the current call's clique.
This will be the parent of the stack frame
that @samp{level clentry} would set the current environment to.
@sp 1
This command will report an error
if the current environment doesn't have the required number of ancestors,
or if there is no execution trace information about the requested ancestor,
or if there is no stack trace information about any of the ancestors
between the current environment and the requested ancestor.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-d} or @samp{--detailed}
specifies that for each ancestor call,
the call's event number, sequence number and depth should also be printed
if the call is to a procedure that is being execution traced.
@sp 1
@item current
@kindex current (mdb command)
Prints the current event.
This is useful if the details of the event,
which were printed when control arrived at the event,
have since scrolled off the screen.
@sp 1
@item view [-vf2] [-w @var{window-cmd}] [-s @var{server-cmd}] [-n @var{server-name}] [-t @var{timeout}]
@itemx view -c [-v] [-s @var{server-cmd}] [-n @var{server-name}]
@kindex view (mdb command)
Opens a new window displaying the source code,
at the location of the current event.
As mdb stops at new events,
the window is updated to track through the source code.
This requires X11 and a version of @samp{vim}
compiled with the client/server option enabled.
@sp 1
The debugger only updates one window at a time.
If you try to open a new source window when there is already one open,
this command aborts with an error message.
@sp 1
The variant with @samp{-c} (or @samp{--close})
does not open a new window but instead
attempts to close a currently open source window.
The attempt may fail if, for example,
the user has modified the source file without saving.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-v} (or @samp{--verbose})
prints the underlying system calls before running them,
and prints any output the calls produced.
This is useful to find out what is wrong if the server does not start.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-f} (or @samp{--force})
stops the command from aborting if there is already a window open.
Instead it attempts to close that window first.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-2} (or @samp{--split-screen})
starts the vim server with two windows,
which allows both the callee as well as the caller
to be displayed at interface events.
The lower window shows what would normally be seen
if the split-screen option was not used,
which at interface events is the caller.
At these events,
the upper window shows the callee definition.
At internal events,
the lower window shows the associated source,
and the view in the upper window
(which is not interesting at these events)
remains unchanged.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-w} (or @samp{--window-command}) specifies
the command to open a new window.
The default is @samp{xterm -e}.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-s} (or @samp{--server-command}) specifies
the command to start the server.
The default is @samp{vim}.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-n} (or @samp{--server-name}) specifies
the name of an existing server.
Instead of starting up a new server,
mdb will attempt to connect to the existing one.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-t} (or @samp{--timeout}) specifies
the maximum number of seconds to wait for the server to start.
@sp 1
@item hold @var{name}[@var{termpath}] [@var{heldname}]
@kindex hold (mdb command)
Holds on to the variable @var{name} of the current event,
or the part of the specified by @var{termpath},
even after execution leaves the current event.
The held value will stay accessible via the name @var{$heldname}.
If @var{heldname} is not specified, it defaults to @var{name}.
There must not already be a held variable named @var{heldname}.
@sp 1
@item diff [-s @var{start}] [-m @var{max}] @var{name1}[@var{termpath1}] @var{name2}[@var{termpath2}]
@kindex diff (mdb command)
Prints a list of some of the term paths
at which the (specified parts of) the specified terms differ.
Normally this command prints the term paths of the first 20 differences.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-s} (or @samp{--start}), if present,
specifies how many of the initial differences to skip.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-m} (or @samp{--max}), if present,
specifies how many differences to print.
@sp 1
@item dump [-qx] goal @var{filename}
@kindex dump (mdb command)
Writes the goal of the current call in its present state of instantiation
to the specified file,
and outputs a message announcing this fact
unless the option @samp{-q} (or @samp{--quiet}) was given.
The option @samp{-x} (or @samp{--xml}) causes the output to be in XML.
@sp 1
@item dump [-qx] exception @var{filename}
Writes the value of the exception at an EXCP port to the specified file,
and outputs a message announcing this fact
unless the option @samp{-q} (or @samp{--quiet}) was given.
Reports an error if the current event does not refer to such a port.

@sp 1
@item dump [-qx] @var{name} @var{filename}
@itemx dump [-qx] @var{num} @var{filename}
Writes the value of the variable in the current environment
with the given ordinal number or with the given name to the specified file,
and outputs a message announcing this fact
unless the option @samp{-q} (or @samp{--quiet}) was given.
The option @samp{-x} (or @samp{--xml}) causes the output to be in XML.
@sp 1
@item open @var{term}
Save @var{term} to a temporary file and open the file in an editor.
The environment variable @env{EDITOR} is consulted to determine what editor to
use.
If this environment variable is not set then @samp{vi} is used.
@var{term} may be any term that can be saved to a file with the
@samp{save_to_file} command.
@sp 1
@item grep @var{pattern} @var{term}
Saves the given term to a temporary file
and invokes grep on the file using @var{pattern}.
@var{term} may be any term that can be saved to a file
with the @samp{save_to_file} command.
The Unix @samp{grep} command must be available from the shell
for this command to work.
@c @sp 1
@c @item dump [-qx] proc_body @var{filename}
@c Writes the representation of the body of the current procedure,

@kindex break (mdb command)
Puts a break point on the specified line of the specified source file,
if there is an event or a call at that position.
If the filename is omitted,
it defaults to the filename from the context of the current event.
@sp 1
The options @samp{-P} or @samp{--print}, and @samp{-S} or @samp{--stop}
specify the action to be taken at the break point.

e.g. @samp{CALL}, @samp{EXIT}, @samp{DISJ}, @samp{SWTC}, etc.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-O} or @samp{--select-one}
selects the action to be taken
if the specification matches more than one procedure.
If you have specified option @samp{-O} or @samp{--select-one},
mdb will report an error;
otherwise, mdb will ask you which of the matched procedures you want to select.
@sp 1
If there is only one event of the given type in the specified procedure,
mdb will put the breakpoint on it;
otherwise, it will ask you whether you want to put a breakpoint
on all matched events or just one, and if so, which one.

@item condition [-b@var{break-num}] [-p] [-v] @var{varname}[@var{pathspec}] @var{op} @var{term}
@kindex condition (mdb command)
Attaches a condition to the most recent breakpoint,
or, if the @samp{-b} or @samp{--break-num} is given,
to the breakpoint whose number is given as the argument.
Execution won't stop at the breakpoint if the condition is false.
@sp 1
The condition is a match between a variable live at the breakpoint,
or a part thereof, and @var{term}.
It is ok for @var{term} to contain spaces.
The term from the program to be matched
is specified by @var{varname};
if it is followed by @var{pathspec} (without a space),
it specifies that the match is to be
against the specified part of @var{varname}.
@sp 1
There are two kinds of values allowed for @var{op}.
If @var{op} is @samp{=} or @samp{==}, the condition is true
if the term specified by @var{varname} (and @var{pathspec}, if present)
matches @var{term}.
If @var{op} is @samp{!=} or @samp{\=}, the condition is true
if the term specified by @var{varname} (and @var{pathspec}, if present)
doesn't match @var{term}.
@var{term} may contain integers and strings
(as long as the strings don't contain double quotes),
but floats and characters aren't supported (yet),
and neither is any special syntax for operators.
Operators can be specified in prefix form
by quoting them with escaped single quotes,
as in @samp{\'+\'(1, 2)}.
Lists can be specified using the usual syntax.
@var{term} also may not contain variables, with one exception:
any occurrence of @samp{_} in @var{term} matches any term.
@sp 1
If execution reaches a breakpoint and the condition cannot be evaluated,
execution will normally stop at that breakpoint with a message to that effect.
If the @samp{-p} or @samp{--dont-require-path} option is given,
execution won't stop at breakpoints at which
the specified part of the specified variable doesn't exist.
If the @samp{-v} or @samp{--dont-require-var} option is given,
execution won't stop at breakpoints at which
the specified variable itself doesn't exist.
The @samp{-v} or @samp{--dont-require-var} option is implicitly assumed
if the specified breakpoint is on all user events.
@sp 1
@item ignore [-E@var{ignore-count}] [-I@var{ignore-count}] @var{num}

The options @samp{-I@var{ignore-count}}
and @samp{--ignore-interface @var{ignore-count}}
tell the debugger to ignore the breakpoint
until after @var{ignore-count} occurrences of interface events
that match the breakpoint with the specified number.
If neither option is given,
the default is to ignore one call event
that matches the breakpoint with the specified number.
Reports an error if there is no break point with the specified number.
@sp 1
@item ignore [-E@var{ignore-count}] [-I@var{ignore-count}]
The options @samp{-E@var{ignore-count}}

and @samp{--ignore-interface @var{ignore-count}}
tell the debugger to ignore the breakpoint
until after @var{ignore-count} occurrences of interface events
that match the most recently added breakpoint.
If neither option is given,
the default is to ignore one call event
that matches the most recently added breakpoint.
Reports an error if the most recently added breakpoint has since been deleted.
@sp 1
@item break_print [-fpv] [-e] [-n] [-b @var{num}] @var{print-spec}*

to the print list of the breakpoint numbered @var{num}
(if the @samp{-b} or @samp{--break-num} option is given),
or to the print list of the most recent breakpoint (if it is not given).
@sp 1
Normally, if a variable with the given name or number doesn't exist
when execution reaches the breakpoint, mdb will issue a warning.
The option @samp{-n} or @samp{--no-warn}, if present, suppresses this warning.
This can be useful if e.g. the name is the name of an output variable,
which of course won't be present at call events.

The principal functor of any term has depth zero.
For subterms which are not lists,
the depth of any argument of the functor is one greater than the
depth of the functor.
For subterms which are lists,
the depth of each element of the list
is one greater than the depth of the list.
@sp 1
@item
@samp{size} is the suggested maximum number of functors to display.
Beyond this limit, subterms may be abbreviated as functor/arity,
or (in lists) may be replaced by an ellipsis (@samp{...}).
For the purposes of this parameter,
the size of a list is one greater than
the sum of the sizes of the elements in the list.
@sp 1
@item
@samp{width} is the width of the screen in characters.
@sp 1
@item
@samp{lines} is the preferred maximum number of lines of one term to display.

@node Declarative debugging mdb commands
@subsection Declarative debugging mdb commands

@sp 1
The following commands relate to the declarative debugger.  See
@ref{Declarative debugging} for details.
@sp 1
@table @code
@item dd [-r] [-R] [-n@var{nodes}] [-s@var{search-mode}] [-p@var{passfile}] [-f@var{failfile}]
@c @item dd [--assume-all-io-is-tabled] [-d@var{depth}] [-t]
@c       [--debug [filename]]
@c The --assume-all-io-is-tabled option is for developers only. Specifying it
@c makes an assertion, and if the assertion is incorrect, the resulting
@c behaviour would be hard for non-developers to understand. The option is
@c therefore deliberately not documented.
@c @sp 1
@c The value of the @samp{-d} or @samp{--depth} option determines
@c how much of the annotated trace to build initially.  Subsequent runs
@c will try to add @var{nodes} events to the annotated trace, but initially
@c there is not enough information available to do this.  We do not document
@c this option since it requires an understanding of the internal workings of
@c the declarative debugger.
@c @sp 1
@c The @samp{-t} or @samp{--test} option causes the declarative debugger
@c to simulate a user who answers `no' to all questions, except for
@c `Is this a bug?' questions to which the simulated user answers `yes'.
@c This is useful for benchmarking the declarative debugger.
@c @sp 1
@c The @samp{--debug} option causes events generated by the declarative
@c debugger to become visible.  This allows the declarative debugger to be
@c debugged.
@c If a filename is provided, the front end of the debugger is not called
@c at all.  Instead a representation of the debugging tree is dumped to
@c the file.
@c @sp 1
Starts declarative debugging using the current event as the initial symptom.
@sp 1
When searching for bugs the declarative debugger needs to keep portions of the
execution trace in memory.  If it requires a new portion of the trace then it
needs to rerun the program.  The @samp{-n@var{nodes}} or
@samp{--nodes @var{nodes}} option tells the declarative debugger how
much of the execution trace to gather when it reruns the program.  A higher
value for @var{nodes} requires more memory, but improves the
performance of the declarative debugger for long running programs since it will
not have to rerun the program as often.
@sp 1
The @samp{-s@var{search-mode}} or @samp{--search-mode @var{search-mode}}
option tells the declarative debugger which
search mode to use.  Valid search modes are @samp{top_down} (or @samp{td}),
@samp{divide_and_query} (or @samp{dq}) and @samp{suspicion_divide_and_query}
(or @samp{sdq}).
@samp{top_down} is the default when this option is not given.
@sp 1
Use the @samp{-r} or @samp{--resume} option to continue your previous
declarative debugging session.  If the @samp{--resume} option is given and
there were no previous declarative debugging sessions then the option will be
ignored.  A @samp{dd --resume} command can be issued at any event.
The @samp{--search-mode} option may be used with the @samp{--resume} option
to change the search mode of a previously started declarative debugging
session.
@sp 1
Use the @samp{-R} or @samp{--reset-knowledge-base} option to reset the
declarative debugger's knowledge base.
The declarative debugger will forget any previous answers that
have been supplied.
It will ask previous questions again if it needs to.
This option does not affect what predicates or modules are trusted.
@sp 1
The arguments supplied to the @samp{--pass-trace-counts} (or @samp{-p}) and
@samp{--fail-trace-counts} (or @samp{-f}) options are either trace count
files or files containing a list of trace count files.
The supplied trace counts are used to assign
a suspicion to each event based on which parts of program were executed in
the failing test case(s), but not the passing test case(s).
This is used to guide the declarative debugger when
the suspicion-divide-and-query search mode is used.  If the
suspicion-divide-and-query search mode is specified then either both the
@samp{-p} and @samp{-f} options must be given, or the @samp{fail_trace_counts}
and @samp{pass_trace_counts} configuration parameters must be set (using
the @samp{set} command).
@item trust @var{module-name}|@var{proc-spec}
@kindex trust (mdb command)
Tells the declarative debugger to trust the given module, predicate or
function.
@sp 1
Individual predicates or functions can be trusted by just giving the
predicate or function name.  If there is more than one predicate or function
with the given name then a list of alternatives will be shown.
@sp 1
The entire Mercury standard library is trusted by default and can be
untrusted in the usual manner using the `untrust' command.  To restore trusted
status to the Mercury standard library issue the command
`trust standard library' or just `trust std lib'.
@sp 1
See also `trusted' and `untrust'.
@sp 1
@item trusted
@kindex trusted (mdb command)
Lists all the trusted modules, predicates and functions.  See also `trust'
and `untrust'.
@sp 1
@item untrust @var{num}
@kindex untrust (mdb command)
Removes the object from the list of trusted objects.  @var{num} should
correspond with the number shown in the list produced by issuing a `trusted'
command.  See also `trust' and `trusted'.
@end table

@sp 1
@node Miscellaneous commands
@subsection Miscellaneous commands

@sp 1
@table @code
@item source [-i] @var{filename} [@var{args}]
@kindex source (mdb command)
Executes the commands in the file named @var{filename}.
Optionally a list of at most nine arguments can be given.
Occurrences of the strings "$1" to "$9" in the sourced file
will be replaced by the corresponding arguments given in the source
command before the commands in the sourced file are executed.
@sp 1
Lines that start with a hash (#) character are ignored.
Hash characters can be used to place comments in your mdb scripts.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-i} or @samp{--ignore-errors} tells @samp{mdb}
not to complain if the named file does not exist or is not readable.
@sp 1
@item save @var{filename}
@kindex save (mdb command)
Saves the persistent state of the debugger
(aliases, print level, scroll controls,
set of breakpoints, browser parameters,
set of objects trusted by the declarative debugger, etc)
to the specified file.
The state is saved in the form of mdb commands,
so that sourcing the file will recreate the saved state.
Note that this command does not save transient state,
such as the current event.
There is also a small part of the persistent state
(breakpoints established with a @samp{break here} command)
that cannot be saved.
@sp 1
@item quit [-y]
@kindex quit (mdb command)
Quits the debugger and aborts the execution of the program.
If the option @samp{-y} is not present, asks for confirmation first.
Any answer starting with @samp{y}, or end-of-file, is considered confirmation.
@sp 1
End-of-file on the debugger's input is considered a quit command.
@end table

@sp 1
@node Experimental commands
@subsection Experimental commands

@sp 1
@table @code
@item histogram_all @var{filename}
@kindex histogram_all (mdb command)
Prints (to file @var{filename})
a histogram that counts all events at various depths
since the start of the program.
This histogram is available
only in some experimental versions of the Mercury runtime system.
@sp 1
@item histogram_exp @var{filename}
@kindex histogram_exp (mdb command)
Prints (to file @var{filename})
a histogram that counts all events at various depths
since the start of the program or since the histogram was last cleared.
This histogram is available
only in some experimental versions of the Mercury runtime system.
@sp 1
@item clear_histogram
@kindex clear_histogram (mdb command)
Clears the histogram printed by @samp{histogram_exp},
i.e.@: sets the counts for all depths to zero.
@sp 1
@item dice [-p@var{filename}] [-f@var{filename}] [-n@var{num}] [-s[pPfFsS]+] [-o @var{filename}] [-m @var{module}]
@kindex dice (mdb command)
Display a program dice on the screen.
@sp 1
A dice is a comparison between
some successful test runs of the program and a failing test run.
Before using the @samp{dice} command one or more passing execution summaries
and one failing execution summary need to be generated.
This can be done by compiling the program with deep tracing enabled
(either by compiling in a .debug or .decldebug grade
or with the @samp{--trace deep} or @samp{--trace rep} compiler options)
and then running the program under mtc.
This will generate a file with the prefix
@samp{.mercury_trace_counts} and a unique suffix,
that contains a summary of the program's execution
This summary is called a slice.
Copy the generated slice to a new file for each test case,
to end up with a failing slice, say @samp{fail},
and some passing slices, say @samp{pass1}, @samp{pass2}, @samp{pass3}, etc.
Union the passing slices with a command such as
@samp{mtc_union -p passes pass1 pass2 pass3}.
@sp 1
The @samp{dice} command can use these files to display a table of statistics
comparing the passing test runs to the failing run.
Here is an example of a dice displayed in an mdb session:
@sp 1
@example
mdb> dice -f fail -p passes -s S -n 4
Procedure        Path/Port  File:Line Pass (3) Fail Suspicion
pred s.mrg/3-0   <s2;c2;e;> s.m:74       0 (0)    1      1.00
pred s.mrg/3-0   <s2;c2;t;> s.m:67      10 (3)    4      0.29
pred s.mrg/3-0   CALL       s.m:64      18 (3)    7      0.28
pred s.mrg/3-0   EXIT       s.m:64      18 (3)    7      0.28
@end example
@sp 1
This example tells us that the @samp{else} in @samp{s.m} on line 74
was executed once in the failing test run,
but never in the passing test runs,
so this would be a good place to start looking for a bug.
@sp 1
Each row in the table contains statistics
about the execution of a separate goal in the program.
Six columns are displayed:
@sp 1
@itemize @bullet
@item @samp{Procedure}:
The procedure in which the goal appears.
@item @samp{Path/Port}:
The goal path and/or port of the goal.  For atomic goals, statistics about the
CALL event and the corresponding EXIT, FAIL or EXCP event are displayed on
separate rows.  For other types of goals the goal path is displayed, except for
NEGE, NEGS and NEGF events where the goal path and port are displayed.
@item @samp{File:Line}:
The file name and line number of the goal.  This can be used to set a
breakpoint on the goal.
@item @samp{Pass (total passing test runs)}:
The total number of times the goal was executed in all the passing test runs.
This is followed by a number in parentheses which indicates the number of test
runs the goal was executed in.  The heading of this column also has a number in
parentheses which is the total number of passing test cases.  In the example
above we can see that 3 passing tests were run.
@item @samp{Fail}:
The number of times the goal was executed in the failing test run.
@item @samp{Suspicion}:
A number between 0 and 1 which gives an indication of how likely a
particular goal is to be buggy.  The is calculated as
Suspicion = F / (P + F) where F is the number of times the goal
was executed in the failing test run and P is the number of times the goal
was executed in passing test runs.
@end itemize
@sp 1
The name of the file containing the failing slice can be specified with the
@samp{-f} or @samp{--fail-trace-counts} option or with a separate
@samp{set fail_trace_count @var{filename}} command.
@sp 1
The name of the file containing the union of the passing slices
can be given with the @samp{-p} or @samp{--pass-trace-counts} option.
Alternatively a separate @samp{set pass_trace_counts @var{filename}} command
can be given.  See @ref{Trace counts} for more information about trace counts.
@sp 1
The table can be sorted on the Pass, Fail or Suspicion columns, or a
combination of these.  This can be done with the @samp{-s} or @samp{--sort}
option.  The argument of this option is a string made up of any combination of
the letters @samp{pPfFsS}.  The letters in the string indicate how the table
should be sorted:
@sp 1
@itemize @bullet
@item @samp{p}: Pass ascending
@item @samp{P}: Pass descending
@item @samp{f}: Fail ascending
@item @samp{F}: Fail descending
@item @samp{s}: Suspicion ascending
@item @samp{S}: Suspicion descending
@end itemize
@sp 1
For example, the string "SF" means sort the table by suspicion, descending, and
if any two suspicions are the same, then by number of executions in the failing
test case, descending.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-n} or @samp{--top} can be used to limit the number lines
displayed.  Only the top @var{num} lines, with respect to
the ordering specified by the @samp{-s} option, will be displayed.
By default the table is limited to 50 lines.
@sp 1
If the @samp{-o} or @samp{--output-to-file} option is given then the output
will be written to the specified file instead of being displayed on the
screen.  Note that the file will be overwritten without warning if it
already exists.
@sp 1
The @samp{-m} or @samp{--module} option limits the output to the given module
and its submodules, if any.

The module names have to be fully qualified,
if a module @var{child} is a submodule of module @var{parent},
the module name list must include @var{parent.child};
listing just @var{child} won't work,
since that is not a fully qualified module name.
@sp 1

@node Declarative debugging
@section Declarative debugging

The debugger incorporates a declarative debugger
which can be accessed from its command line.
Starting from an event that exhibits a bug,
e.g.@: an event giving a wrong answer,
the declarative debugger can find a bug which explains that behaviour
using knowledge of the intended interpretation of the program only.

Note that this is a work in progress,
so there are some limitations in the implementation.

@node Declarative debugging overview
@subsection Overview

The declarative debugger tries to find a bug in your program by asking
questions about the correctness of calls executed in your program.

Because pure Mercury code does not have any side effects, the declarative
debugger can make inferences such as ``if a call produces incorrect output
from correct input, then there must be a bug in the code executed by one of
the descendents of the call''.

The declarative debugger is therefore able to automate much of the
`detective work' that must be done manually when using the
procedural debugger.

@node Declarative debugging concepts
@subsection Concepts

Every CALL event corresponds to an atomic goal,
the one printed by the "print" command at that event.
This atom has the actual arguments in the input argument positions
and distinct free variables in the output argument positions
(including the return value for functions).
We refer to this as the @emph{call atom} of the event.

The same view can be taken of EXIT events,
although in this case the outputs as well as the inputs will be bound.
We refer to this as the @emph{exit atom} of the event.
The exit atom is always an instance of
the call atom for the corresponding CALL event.

Using these concepts, it is possible to interpret
the events at which control leaves a procedure
as assertions about the semantics of the program.
These assertions may be true or false, depending on whether or not
the program's actual semantics are consistent with its intended semantics.

@sp 1
@table @asis
@item EXIT
The assertion corresponding to an EXIT event is that
the exit atom is valid in the intended interpretation.
In other words, the procedure generates correct outputs
for the given inputs.
@sp 1
@item FAIL
Every FAIL event has a matching CALL event,
and a (possibly empty) set of matching EXIT events
between the call and fail.
The assertion corresponding to a FAIL event is that
every instance of the call atom which is true in the intended interpretation
is an instance of one of the exit atoms.
In other words, the procedure generates the complete set of answers
for the given inputs.
(Note that this does not imply that all exit atoms represent correct answers;
some exit atoms may in fact be wrong,
but the truth of the assertion is not affected by this.)
@sp 1
@item EXCP
Every EXCP event is associated with an exception term,
and has a matching CALL event.
The assertion corresponding to an EXCP event is that
the call atom can abnormally terminate with the given exception.
In other words, the thrown exception was expected for that call.
@end table

If one of these assertions is wrong,
then we consider the event to represent incorrect behaviour of the program.
If the user encounters an event for which the assertion is wrong,
then they can request the declarative debugger to
diagnose the incorrect behaviour by giving the @samp{dd} command
to the procedural debugger at that event.

@node Oracle questions
@subsection Oracle questions

Once the @samp{dd} command has been given,
the declarative debugger asks the user
a series of questions about the truth of various assertions
in the intended interpretation.
The first question in this series will be about
the validity of the event for which the @samp{dd} command was given.
The answer to this question will nearly always be ``no'',
since the user has just implied the assertion is false
by giving the @samp{dd} command.
Later questions will be about other events
in the execution of the program,
not all of them necessarily of the same kind as the first.

The user is expected to act as an ``oracle''
and provide answers to these questions
based on their knowledge of the intended interpretation.
The debugger provides some help here:
previous answers are remembered and used where possible,
so questions are not repeated unnecessarily.
Commands are available to provide answers,
as well as to browse the arguments more closely
or to change the order in which the questions are asked.
See the next section for details of the commands that are available.

When seeking to determine the validity of
the assertion corresponding to an EXIT event,
the declarative debugger prints the exit atom
followed by the question @samp{Valid?} for the user to answer.
The atom is printed using
the same mechanism that the debugger uses to print values,
which means some arguments may be abbreviated if they are too large.

When seeking to determine the validity of
the assertion corresponding to a FAIL event,
the declarative debugger prints the call atom, prefixed by @samp{Call},
followed by each of the exit atoms
(indented, and on multiple lines if need be),
and prints the question @samp{Complete?} (or @samp{Unsatisfiable?} if there
are no solutions) for the user to answer.
Note that the user is not required to provide any missing instance
in the case that the answer is no.
(A limitation of the current implementation is that
it is difficult to browse a specific exit atom.
This will hopefully be addressed in the near future.)

When seeking to determine the validity of
the assertion corresponding to an EXCP event,
the declarative debugger prints the call atom
followed by the exception that was thrown,
and prints the question @samp{Expected?} for the user to answer.

In addition to asserting whether a call behaved correctly or not
the user may also assert that a call should never have occurred in the first
place, because its inputs violated some precondition of the call.  For example
if an unsorted list is passed to a predicate that is only designed to work with
sorted lists.  Such calls should be deemed @emph{inadmissible} by the user.
This tells the declarative debugger that either the call was given the wrong
input by its caller or whatever generated the input is incorrect.

In some circumstances
the declarative debugger provides a default answer to the question.
If this is the case, the default answer will be shown in square brackets
immediately after the question,
and simply pressing @key{RET} is equivalent to giving that answer.

@node Declarative debugging commands
@subsection Commands

At the above mentioned prompts, the following commands may be given.
Most commands can be abbreviated by their first letter.

It is also legal to press @key{RET} without specifying a command.
If there is a default answer (@pxref{Oracle questions}),
pressing @key{RET} is equivalent to giving that answer.
If there is no default answer,
pressing @key{RET} is equivalent to the skip command.

@item track [-a] [@var{term-path}]
The @samp{track} command can only be given from within the interactive
term browser and tells the declarative debugger to find the point at which
the current subterm was bound.
If no argument is given the current subterm is taken to be incorrect.
If a @var{term-path} is given then the subterm at @var{term-path} relative to
the current subterm will be considered incorrect.
The declarative debugger will ask about the call that bound the given subterm
next.
To find out the location of the unification that bound the subterm,
issue an @samp{info} command when asked about the call that bound the subterm.
The declarative debugger can use one of two algorithms to find the
point at which the subterm was bound.
The first algorithm uses some heuristics
to find the subterm more quickly than the second algorithm.
It is possible, though unlikely,
for the first algorithm to find the wrong call.
The first algorithm is the default.
To tell the declarative debugger to
use the second, more accurate but slower algorithm,
give the @samp{-a} or @samp{--accurate} option to the @samp{track} command.
@item mark [-a] [@var{term-path}]
The @samp{mark} command has the same effect as the @samp{track} command
except that it also asserts that the atom is inadmissible or erroneous,
depending on whether the subterm is input or output respectively.
@sp 1
@item pd

This command is notionally the inverse of the @samp{dd} command
in the procedural debugger.
The session can be resumed with a @samp{dd --resume} command.

@node Diagnoses
@subsection Diagnoses

If the oracle keeps providing answers to the asked questions,
then the declarative debugger will eventually locate a bug.
A ``bug'', for our purposes,
is an assertion about some call which is false,
but for which the assertions about every child of that call are not false
(i.e. they are either correct or inadmissible).
There are four different classes of bugs that this debugger can diagnose,
one associated with each kind of assertion.

Assertions about EXIT events
lead to a kind of bug we call an ``incorrect contour''.
This is a contour (an execution path through the body of a clause)
which results in a wrong answer for that clause.
When the debugger diagnoses a bug of this kind, it displays the exit atoms in
the contour.  The resulting incorrect exit atom is displayed last.  The program
event associated with this bug, which we call the ``bug event'', is the exit
event at the end of the contour.

Assertions about FAIL events lead to a kind of bug we call
a ``partially uncovered atom''.
This is a call atom which has some instance which is valid,
but which is not covered by any of the applicable clauses.
When the debugger diagnoses a bug of this kind,
it displays the call atom;
it does not, however,
provide an actual instance that satisfies the above condition.
The bug event in this case is the fail event
reached after all the solutions were exhausted.

Assertions about EXCP events lead to a kind of bug we call
an ``unhandled exception''.
This is a contour which throws an exception
that needs to be handled but which is not handled.
When the debugger diagnoses a bug of this kind,
it displays the call atom
followed by the exception which was not handled.
The bug event in this case is the exception event
for the call in question.

If the assertion made by an EXIT, FAIL or EXCP event is false and one or
more of the children of the call that resulted in the incorrect EXIT, FAIL or
EXCP event is inadmissible, while all the other calls are correct, then an
``inadmissible call'' bug has been found.  This is a call that behaved
incorrectly (by producing the incorrect output, failing or throwing an
exception) because it passed unexpected input to one of it's children.
The guilty call is displayed as well as the inadmissible child.

After the diagnosis is displayed, the user is asked to confirm
that the event located by the declarative debugger
does in fact represent a bug.
The user can answer @samp{yes} or @samp{y} to confirm the bug,
@samp{no} or @samp{n} to reject the bug,
or @samp{abort} or @samp{a} to abort the diagnosis.

If the user confirms the diagnosis,
they are returned to the procedural debugger
at the event which was found to be the bug event.
This gives the user an opportunity, if they need it,
to investigate (procedurally) the events in the neighbourhood of the bug.

If the user rejects the diagnosis,
which implies that some of their earlier answers may have been mistakes,
diagnosis is resumed from some earlier point determined by the debugger.
The user may now be asked questions they have already answered,
with the previous answer they gave being the default,
or they may be asked entirely new questions.

If the user aborts the diagnosis,
they are returned to the event at which the @samp{dd} command was given.

@node Search modes
@subsection Search modes

The declarative debugger can operate in one of several modes when
searching for a bug.
Different search modes will result in different sequences of questions
being asked by the declarative debugger.
The user can specify which mode to use by giving the
@samp{--search-mode} option to the @samp{dd} command (see
@ref{Declarative debugging mdb commands}) or with the @samp{mode} declarative
debugger command (see @ref{Declarative debugging commands}).

@subsubsection Top-down mode

Using this mode the declarative debugger will ask about the children of the
last question the user answered @samp{no} to.  The child calls will be asked
about in the order they were executed.  This makes the search more predictable
from the user's point of view as the questions will more or less follow the
program execution.  The drawback of top-down search is that it may require a
lot of questions to be answered before a bug is found, especially with deeply
recursive programs.

This search mode is used by default when no other mode is specified.

@subsubsection Divide and query mode

With this search mode the declarative debugger attempts to halve the size
of the search space with each question.  In many cases this will result in the
bug being found after O(log(N)) questions where N is the number of events
between the event where the @samp{dd} command was given and the corresponding
@samp{CALL} event.  This makes the search feasible for long running programs
where top-down search would require an unreasonably large number of questions
to be answered.  However, the questions may appear to come from unrelated parts
of the program which can make them harder to answer.

@subsubsection Suspicion divide and query mode

In this search mode the declarative debugger assigns a suspicion level to
each event based on which parts of the program were executed in failing
test cases, but not in passing test cases.  It then attempts to divide the
search space into two areas of equal suspicion with each question.  This tends
to result in questions about parts of the program executed in a failing test
case, but not in passing test cases.

@subsubsection Binary search mode

The user may ask the declarative debugger to do a binary search along the
path in the call tree between the current question and the question that the
user last answered @samp{no} to.  This is useful, for example, when a
recursive predicate is producing incorrect output, but the base case is
correct.

@node Improving the search
@subsection Improving the search

The number of questions asked by the declarative debugger before it pinpoints
the location of a bug can be reduced by giving it extra information.  The kind
of extra information that can be given and how to convey this information are
explained in this section.

@subsubsection Tracking suspicious subterms

An incorrect subterm can be tracked to the call that bound the subterm
from within the interactive term browser
(see @ref{Declarative debugging commands}).

After issuing a @samp{track} command,
the next question asked by the declarative debugger will
be about the call that bound the incorrect subterm,
unless that call was
eliminated as a possible bug because of an answer to a previous
question or the call that bound the subterm was not traced.

For example consider the following fragment of a program that calculates
payments for a loan:

@example
:- type payment
        --->   payment(
                       date    :: date,
                       amount  :: float
               ).

:- type date ---> date(int, int, int).  % date(day, month, year).

:- pred get_payment(loan::in, int::in, payment::out) is det.

get_payment(Loan, PaymentNo, Payment) :-
    get_payment_amount(Loan, PaymentNo, Amount),
    get_payment_date(Loan, PaymentNo, Date),
    Payment = payment(Date, Amount).
@end example

Suppose that @code{get_payment} produces an incorrect result and the
declarative debugger asks:

@noindent
@example
get_payment(loan(...), 10, payment(date(9, 10, 1977), 10.000000000000)).
Valid?
@end example

Then if we know that this is the right payment amount for the given loan,
but the date is incorrect, we can track the @code{date(...)} subterm and the
debugger will then ask us about @code{get_payment_date}:

@noindent
@example
get_payment(loan(...), 10, payment(date(9, 10, 1977), 10.000000000000)).
Valid? browse
browser> cd 3/1
browser> ls
date(9, 10, 1977)
browser> track
get_payment_date(loan(...), 10, date(9, 10, 1977)).
Valid?
@end example

Thus irrelevant questions about @code{get_payment_amount} are avoided.

@noindent
If, say, the date was only wrong in the year part, then we could also have
tracked the year subterm in which case the next question would have been about
the call that constructed the year part of the date.

This feature is also useful when using the procedural debugger.  For example,
suppose that you come across a @samp{CALL} event and you would like to know the
source of a particular input to the call.  To find out you could first go to
the final event by issuing a @samp{finish} command.  Invoke the declarative
debugger with a @samp{dd} command and then track the input term you are
interested in.  The next question will be about the call that bound the term.
Issue a @samp{pd} command at this point to return to the procedural debugger.
It will now show the final event of the call that bound the term.

Note that this feature is only available if the executable is compiled
in a .decldebug grade or with the @samp{--trace rep} option.  If a module
is compiled with the @samp{--trace rep} option but other modules in the
program are not then you will not be able to track subterms through those
other modules.

@subsubsection Trusting predicates, functions and modules

The declarative debugger can also be told to assume that certain predicates,
functions or entire modules do not contain any bugs.  The declarative
debugger will never ask questions about trusted predicates or functions.  It
is a good idea to trust standard library modules imported by a program being
debugged.

The declarative debugger can be told which predicates/functions it can trust
before the @samp{dd} command is given.  This is done using the @samp{trust},
@samp{trusted} and @samp{untrust} commands at the mdb prompt (see
@ref{Declarative debugging mdb commands} for details on how to use these
commands).

Trust commands may be placed in the @samp{.mdbrc} file which contains default
settings for mdb (see @ref{Mercury debugger invocation}).  Trusted
predicates will also be exported with a @samp{save} command (see
@ref{Miscellaneous commands}).

During the declarative debugging session the user may tell the declarative
debugger to trust the predicate or function in the current question.
Alternatively the user may tell the declarative debugger to trust all the
predicates and functions in the same module as the predicate or function in the
current question.  See the @samp{trust} command in
@ref{Declarative debugging commands}.

@subsubsection When different search modes are used

If a search mode is given when invoking the declarative debugger then that
search mode will be used, unless (a) a subterm is tracked during the session,
or (b) the user has not answered @samp{no} to any questions yet,
in which case top-down search is used until @samp{no} is answered to at least
one question.

If no search mode is specified with the @samp{dd} command then
the search mode depends on if the @samp{--resume} option is
given.
If it is then the previous search mode will be used,
otherwise top-down search will be used.

You can check the search mode used to find a particular question by issuing
an @samp{info} command at the question prompt in the declarative debugger.
You can also change the search mode from within the declarative debugger
with the @samp{mode} command.

@node Trace counts
@section Trace counts

A program with debugging enabled may be run in a special mode
that causes it to write out to a @emph{trace count file}
a record of how many times each @emph{debugger event} in the program
was executed during that run.

Trace counts are useful for determining
what parts of a failing program are being run
and possibly causing the failure;
this is called @emph{slicing}.
Slices from failing and passing runs can be compared
to see which parts of the program are being executed during failing runs,
but not during passing runs; this is called @emph{dicing}.

@menu

@end menu

@node Generating trace counts
@subsection Generating trace counts

To generate a slice for a program run,
first compile the program with deep tracing enabled
(either by using the @samp{--trace deep} option
or by compiling the program in a debugging grade).
Then invoke the program with the @samp{mtc} script,
passing any required arguments after the program name.
@sp 1
For example:
@sp 1
@example
mtc ./myprog arg1 arg2
@end example
@sp 1
The program will run as usual, except that when it terminates
it will write the number of times each debugger event was executed
to a trace count file.
@sp 1
@samp{mtc} accepts an @samp{-o} or @samp{--output-file} option.
The argument to this option is the filename to use
for the generated trace count file.
If this option is not given,
then the trace count will be written to a file
with the prefix @samp{.mercury_trace_counts} and a unique suffix.
@sp 1
Ordinarily, the generated trace count file will list
only the debugger events that were actually executed during this run.
However, it will list all debugger events, even unexecuted ones,
if @samp{mtc} is given the @samp{-c} or @samp{--coverage-test} option.
@sp 1
@samp{mtc} also supports two more options intended for coverage testing:
@samp{-s} or @samp{--summary-file}, and @samp{--summary-count}.
These each set an option in the @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS} environment variable,
@samp{--trace-count-summary-file} and @samp{--trace-count-summary-max}
respectively.
For the documentation of these @samp{mtc} options,
see the documentation of @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS} environment variable.

@sp 1

Trace count files
can be manipulated with the @samp{mtc_union} and @samp{mtc_diff} tools,
and they can be analysed by the @samp{mslice} and @samp{mdice} tools.
They can also be used to help direct a declarative debugging search
(see @ref{Search modes}).

@sp 1

@node Combining trace counts
@subsection Combining trace counts

The @samp{mtc_union} tool can be used
to combine several trace count files into one trace count file.
You need to use this when you have
many trace count files you wish to analyse with @samp{mslice} or @samp{mdice}.

@samp{mtc_union} is invoked by issuing a command of the form:
@sp 1
@example
mtc_union [-v] -o output_file file1 file2 @dots{}
@end example
@sp 1
@samp{file1}, @samp{file2}, etc.
are the trace count files that should be combined.
The new trace count file will be written to @samp{output_file}.
This file will preserve
the count of the test cases that contributed to its contents,
even if some of @samp{file1}, @samp{file2}, etc themselves
were created by @samp{mtc_union}.
If the @samp{-v} or @samp{--verbose} option is specified
then a progress message will be displayed
as each file is read and its contents merged into the union.

The @samp{mtc_diff} tool can be used
to subtract one trace count file from another.

@samp{mtc_diff} is invoked by issuing a command of the form:
@sp 1
@example
mtc_diff -o output_file file1 file2
@end example
@sp 1
@samp{file1} and @samp{file2} must both be trace counts files.
The output, written to @samp{output_file}, will contain
the difference between the trace counts in @samp{file1} and @samp{file2}
for every event that occurs in @samp{file1}.
Unlike @samp{mtc_union}, @samp{mtc_diff} does not preserve
the count of the test cases that contributed to its contents in any useful way.

@sp 1

@node Slicing
@subsection Slicing

Once a slice has been generated
it can be viewed in various ways using the mslice tool.
The output of the mslice tool will look something like the following:
@sp 1
@example
Procedure            Path/Port File:Line Count (1)
pred mrg.merge/3-0   CALL      mrg.m:60     14 (1)
pred mrg.merge/3-0   EXIT      mrg.m:60     14 (1)
pred mrg.msort_n/4-0 CALL      mrg.m:33     12 (1)
pred mrg.msort_n/4-0 EXIT      mrg.m:33     12 (1)
pred mrg.msort_n/4-0 <?;>      mrg.m:35     12 (1)
@end example
@sp 1
Each row corresponds to a label in the program.
The meanings of the columns are as follows:
@itemize @bullet
@item @samp{Procedure}:
This column displays the procedure that the label relates to.
@item @samp{Path/Port}:
For interface events this column displays the event port,
while for internal events it displays the goal path.
(See @ref{Tracing of Mercury programs}
for an explanation of interface and internal events.)
@item @samp{File:Line}:
This column displays the context of the event.
@item @samp{Count}:
This column displays how many times the event was executed.
The number in parentheses for each event row
says in how many runs the event was executed.
The number in parentheses in the heading row (after the word "Count")
indicates how many runs were represented
in the trace counts file analysed by the mslice tool.
@end itemize

@sp 1

The mslice tool is invoked using a command of the form:
@example
mslice [-s sortspec] [-l N] [-m module] [-n N] [-p N] [-f N] file
@end example
@sp 1
where @samp{file} is a trace count file,
generated either directly by a program run
or indirectly by the @samp{mtc_union} or @samp{mtc_diff} tools.
@sp 1
The @samp{-s} or @samp{--sort} option
specifies how the output should be sorted.
@samp{sortspec} should be a string made up of
any combination of the letters @samp{cCtT}.
Each letter specifies a column and direction to sort on:
@itemize @bullet
@item @samp{c}: Count ascending
@item @samp{C}: Count descending
@item @samp{t}: Number of runs ascending
@item @samp{T}: Number of runs descending
@end itemize
@sp 1
For example, the option @samp{-s cT} will sort the output table
by the Count column in ascending order.
If the counts for two or more events are the same,
then those events will be sorted by number of runs in descending order.
@sp 1
The default is to sort descending on the Count column.
@sp 1
The @samp{-l} or @samp{--limit} option limits the output to @samp{N} lines.

@node Dicing
@subsection Dicing

A dice is a comparison between passing and failing runs of a program.
@sp 1
Dice are created using the @samp{mdice} tool.
To use the @samp{mdice} tool,
one must first generate a set of trace count files for passing runs
and a set of trace count files for failing runs
using the @samp{mtc} tool (@ref{Generating trace counts}).
Once this has been done,
and the union of each set computed using @samp{mtc_union},
@samp{mdice} can be used to display a table of statistics
that compares the passing runs to the failing runs.
@sp 1
Here is an example of the output of the @samp{mdice} tool:
@sp 1
@example
Procedure        Path/Port  File:Line Pass (3) Fail Suspicion
pred s.mrg/3-0   <s2;c2;e;> s.m:74       0 (0)    1      1.00
pred s.mrg/3-0   <s2;c2;t;> s.m:67      10 (3)    4      0.29
pred s.mrg/3-0   CALL       s.m:64      18 (3)    7      0.28
pred s.mrg/3-0   EXIT       s.m:64      18 (3)    7      0.28
@end example
@sp 1
This example tells us that the @samp{else} in @samp{s.m} on line 74
was executed once in the failing test run,
but never during the passing test runs,
so this would be a good place to start looking for a bug.
@sp 1
Each row corresponds to an event in the program.
The meanings of the columns are as follows:
@itemize @bullet
@item @samp{Procedure}:
This column displays the procedure the event relates to.
@item @samp{Path/Port}:
For interface events this column displays the event port,
while for internal events it displays the goal path.
(See @ref{Tracing of Mercury programs}
for an explanation of interface and internal events.)
@item @samp{File:Line}:
This column displays the context of the event.
@item @samp{Pass (total passing test runs)}:
This columns displays the total number of times
the event was executed in all the passing test runs.
This is followed by a number in parentheses
which indicates the number of test runs the event was executed in.
The heading of this column also has a number in parentheses
which is the total number of passing test cases.
@item @samp{Fail}:
This column displays the number of times
the goal was executed in the failing test run(s).
@item @samp{Suspicion}:
This columns displays a number between 0 and 1
which gives an indication of how likely a particular goal is to contain a bug.
The suspicion is calculated as Suspicion = F / (P + F)
where F is the number of times the goal was executed in failing runs
and P is the number of times the goal was executed in passing runs.
@end itemize
@sp 1
The @samp{mdice} tool is invoked with a command of the form:
@sp 1
@example
mdice [-s sortspec] [-l N] [-m module] [-n N] [-p N] [-f N] passfile failfile
@end example
@samp{passfile} is a trace count file,
generated either directly by a passing program run
or as the union of the trace count files of passing program runs.
@samp{failfile} is a trace count file,
generated either directly by a failing program run
or as the union of the trace count files of failing program runs.
@sp 1
The table can be sorted on the Pass, Fail or Suspicion columns,
or a combination of these.
This can be done with the @samp{-s} or @samp{--sort} option.
The argument of this option is a string
made up of any combination of the letters @samp{pPfFsS}.
The letters in the string indicate how the table should be sorted:
@sp 1
@itemize @bullet
@item @samp{p}: Pass ascending
@item @samp{P}: Pass descending
@item @samp{f}: Fail ascending
@item @samp{F}: Fail descending
@item @samp{s}: Suspicion ascending
@item @samp{S}: Suspicion descending
@end itemize
@sp 1
For example the string "SF" means
sort the table by suspicion in descending order,
and if any two suspicions are the same,
then by number of executions in the failing run(s), also in descending order.
@sp 1
The default is to sort descending on the Suspicion column.
@sp 1
The option @samp{-l} or @samp{--limit}
can be used to limit the number of lines displayed.
@sp 1
The @samp{-m} or @samp{--module} option
limits the output to the given module and any submodules.
@sp 1
The @samp{-n} or @samp{--max-name-column} option's argument
gives the maximum width of the column containing predicate names.
If the argument is zero, there is no maximum width.
@sp 1
The @samp{-p} or @samp{--max-path-column} option's argument
gives the maximum width of the column containing ports and goal paths.
If the argument is zero, there is no maximum width.
@sp 1
The @samp{-f} or @samp{--max-file-column} option's argument
gives the maximum width of the column containing file names and line numbers.
If the argument is zero, there is no maximum width.
@sp 1

@node Coverage testing
@subsection Coverage testing

Coverage testing is the process of finding out
which parts of the code of a program
are not executed during any test case,
so that new test cases can be designed specifically to exercise those parts.
@sp 1
The first step in coverage testing a Mercury program
is compiling that program with execution tracing enabled,
either by using the @samp{--trace deep} option
or by compiling the program in a debugging grade.
The second step is to execute that program on all its test cases
with coverage testing enabled.
This can be done either by running the program with @samp{mtc --coverage-test},
or by including one of the corresponding options
(@samp{--coverage-test} or @samp{--coverage-test-if-exec=@var{programname}})
in the value of the @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS} environment variable.
These runs generate a set of trace counts files
that can be given to the Mercury test coverage tool, the @samp{mcov} program.
As usual, trace count files are named with the prefix
@samp{.mercury_trace_counts} if the @samp{mtc --output-file} option is not
given.
@sp 1
The @samp{mcov} tool is invoked with a command of the form:
@sp 1
@example
mcov [-d] [-v] [-o output_file] tracecountfile1 @dots{}
@end example
The arguments consist of one or more trace count files.
The output will normally be a list of all the procedures in the program
that were not executed in any of the runs
that generated these trace count files.
The output will go to standard output
unless this is overridden by the @samp{-o} or @samp{--output-file} option.
@sp 1
If the @samp{-d} or @samp{--detailed} option is specified,
then the output will list all the @emph{events} in the program
that were not executed in any of these runs.
This option can thus show the unexecuted parts of the executed procedures.
@sp 1
If the @samp{-v} or @samp{--verbose} option is specified,
then a progress message will be displayed as each file is read.

@node Profiling introduction
@section Profiling introduction
@cindex Profiling
@cindex Measuring performance
@cindex Optimization
@cindex Efficiency
@cindex Parallel performance

To obtain the best trade-off between productivity and efficiency,
programmers should not spend too much time optimizing their code
until they know which parts of the code are really taking up most of the time.
Only once the code has been profiled should the programmer consider
making optimizations that would improve efficiency
at the expense of readability or ease of maintenance.
A good profiler is therefore a tool
that should be part of every software engineer's toolkit.

Mercury programs can be analyzed using two distinct profilers.
The Mercury profiler @samp{mprof} is a conventional call-graph profiler
(or graph profiler for short) in the style of @samp{gprof}.
The Mercury deep profiler @samp{mdprof} is a new kind of profiler
that associates a lot more context with each measurement.
@samp{mprof} can be used to profile either time or space,
but not both at the same time;
@samp{mdprof} can profile both time and space at the same time.

The parallel execution of Mercury programs can be analyzed with a third
profiler called @samp{threadscope}.
@samp{threadscope} allows programmers to visualise CPU utilisation for work,
garbage collection, and idle time.
This enables programmers to see the effect of parallelization decisions such as
task granularity.
The @samp{threadscope} tool is not included with the Melbourne Mercury
Compiler,
See @url{http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/threadscope/,
Threadscope: Performance Tuning Parallel Haskell Programs}.

To enable profiling, your program must be built with profiling enabled.
The three different profilers require different support,
and thus you must choose which one to enable when you build your program.

@itemize @bullet
@item
To build your program with time profiling enabled for @samp{mprof},
pass the @samp{-p} (@samp{--profiling}) option to @samp{mmc}
(and also to @samp{mgnuc} and @samp{ml}, if you invoke them separately).
@item
To build your program with memory profiling enabled for @samp{mprof},
pass the @samp{--memory-profiling} option to @samp{mmc},
@samp{mgnuc} and @samp{ml}.
@item
To build your program with deep profiling enabled (for @samp{mdprof}),
pass the @samp{--deep-profiling} option to @samp{mmc},
@samp{mgnuc} and @samp{ml}.
@item
To build your program with threadscope profiling enabled (for @samp{threadscope}).
pass the @samp{--parallel} and @samp{--threadscope} options to @samp{mmc},
@samp{mgnuc} and @samp{ml}.
@end itemize

If you are using Mmake,
then you pass these options to all the relevant programs
by setting the @samp{GRADEFLAGS} variable in your Mmakefile,
e.g.@: by adding the line @samp{GRADEFLAGS=--profiling}.
(For more information about the different grades,
see @ref{Compilation model options}.)

Enabling @samp{mprof} or @samp{mdprof} profiling has several effects.
First, it causes the compiler to generate slightly modified code,
which counts the number of times each predicate or function is called,
and for every call, records the caller and callee.
With deep profiling, there are other modifications as well, the most important
impact of which is the loss of tail-recursion.
(By default, the deep profiling versions of the library and runtime are built
with @samp{--stack-segments} in order to minimize this impact.)
Second, your program will be linked with versions of the library and runtime
that were compiled with the same kind of profiling enabled.
Third, if you enable graph profiling,
the compiler will generate for each source file
the static call graph for that file in @samp{@var{module}.prof}.

Enabling @samp{threadscope} profiling causes the compiler to build the program
against a different runtime system.
This runtime system logs events relevant to parallel execution.
@samp{threadscope} support is not compatible with all processors,
see @file{README.ThreadScope} for more information.

Once you have created a profiled executable,
you can gather profiling information by running the profiled executable
on some test data that is representative of the intended uses of the program.
The profiling version of your program
will collect profiling information during execution,
and save this information at the end of execution,
provided execution terminates normally and not via an abort.

Executables compiled with @samp{--profiling}
save profiling data in the files
@file{Prof.Counts}, @file{Prof.Decls}, and @file{Prof.CallPair}.
(@file{Prof.Decl} contains the names
of the procedures and their associated addresses,
@file{Prof.CallPair} records the number of times
each procedure was called by each different caller,
and @file{Prof.Counts} records the number of times
that execution was in each procedure when a profiling interrupt occurred.)
Executables compiled with @samp{--memory-profiling}
will use two of those files (@file{Prof.Decls} and @file{Prof.CallPair})
and a two others: @file{Prof.MemoryWords} and @file{Prof.MemoryCells}.
Executables compiled with @samp{--deep-profiling}
save profiling data in a single file, @file{Deep.data}.
Executables compiled with the @samp{--threadscope} option write profiling data
to a file whose name is that of the program being profiled with the extension
@samp{.eventlog}.
For example, the profile for the program @samp{my_program} would be written to
the file @file{my_program.eventlog}.

It is also possible to combine @samp{mprof} profiling results
from multiple runs of your program.
You can do by running your program several times,
and typing @samp{mprof_merge_counts} after each run.
It is not (yet) possible to combine @samp{mdprof} profiling results
from multiple runs of your program.

Due to a known timing-related bug in our code,
you may occasionally get segmentation violations
when running your program with @samp{mprof} profiling enabled.
If this happens, just run it again --- the problem occurs only very rarely.
The same vulnerability does not occur with @samp{mdprof} profiling.

With the @samp{mprof} and @samp{mdprof} profilers,
you can control whether time profiling measures
real (elapsed) time, user time plus system time, or user time only,
by including the options @samp{-Tr}, @samp{-Tp}, or @samp{-Tv} respectively
in the environment variable @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS}
when you run the program to be profiled.
@c (See the environment variables section below.)
Currently, only the @samp{-Tr} option works on Cygwin; on that
platform it is the default.
@c the above sentence is duplicated below

The default is user time plus system time,
which counts all time spent executing the process,
including time spent by the operating system working on behalf of the process,
but not including time that the process was suspended
(e.g.@: due to time slicing, or while waiting for input).
When measuring real time,
profiling counts even periods during which the process was suspended.
When measuring user time only,
profiling does not count time inside the operating system at all.

@node Using mprof for time profiling
@section Using mprof for time profiling
@pindex mprof
@cindex Time profiling

To display the graph profile information
gathered from one or more profiling runs,
just type @samp{mprof} or @samp{mprof -c}.
(For programs built with @samp{--high-level-code},
you need to also pass the @samp{--no-demangle} option to @samp{mprof} as well.)
@findex --high-level-code
@findex --demangle
@findex --no-demangle
Note that @samp{mprof} can take quite a while to execute
(especially with @samp{-c}),
and will usually produce quite a lot of output,
so you will usually want to redirect the output into a file
with a command such as @samp{mprof > mprof.out}.

The output of @samp{mprof -c} consists of three major sections.
These are named the call graph profile,
the flat profile and the alphabetic listing.
The output of @samp{mprof} contains
the flat profile and the alphabetic listing only.

@cindex Call graph profile
The call graph profile presents the local call graph of each procedure.
For each procedure it shows
the parents (callers) and children (callees) of that procedure,
and shows the execution time and call counts for each parent and child.
It is sorted on the total amount of time spent
in the procedure and all of its descendents
(i.e.@: all of the procedures that it calls, directly or indirectly.)

@cindex Flat profile
The flat profile presents the just execution time spent in each procedure.
It does not count the time spent in descendents of a procedure.

The alphabetic listing just lists the procedures in alphabetical order,
along with their index number in the call graph profile,
so that you can quickly find the entry for a particular procedure
in the call graph profile.

@cindex Profiling interrupts
The profiler works by interrupting the program at frequent intervals,
and each time recording the currently active procedure and its caller.
It uses these counts to determine
the proportion of the total time spent in each procedure.
This means that the figures calculated for these times
are only a statistical approximation to the real values,
and so they should be treated with some caution.
In particular, if the profiler's assumption
that calls to a procedure from different callers have roughly similar costs
is not true,
the graph profile can be quite misleading.

The time spent in a procedure and its descendents is calculated by
propagating the times up the call graph,
assuming that each call to a procedure from a particular caller
takes the same amount of time.
This assumption is usually reasonable,
but again the results should be treated with caution.
(The deep profiler does not make such an assumption,
and hence its output is significantly more reliable.)

@cindex Garbage collection, profiling
Note that any time spent in a C function
(e.g.@: time spent in @samp{GC_malloc()},
which does memory allocation and garbage collection)
is credited to the Mercury procedure that called that C function.

Here is a small portion of the call graph profile from an example program.

@example
                                  called/total       parents
index  %time    self descendents  called+self    name           index
                                  called/total       children

@end example

The first entry is @samp{call_engine_label} and its parent is
@samp{<spontaneous>}, meaning that it is the root of the call graph.
(The first three entries, @samp{call_engine_label}, @samp{do_interpreter},
and @samp{io.run/0} are all part of the Mercury runtime;
@samp{main/2} is the entry point to the user's program.)

Each entry of the call graph profile consists of three sections, the parent
procedures, the current procedure and the children procedures.

Reading across from the left, for the current procedure the fields are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The unique index number for the current procedure.
(The index numbers are used only to make it easier to find
a particular entry in the call graph.)

@item
The percentage of total execution time spent in the current procedure
and all its descendents.
As noted above, this is only a statistical approximation.

@item
The ``self'' time: the time spent executing code that is
part of current procedure.
As noted above, this is only a statistical approximation.

@item
The descendent time: the time spent in the
current procedure and all its descendents.
As noted above, this is only a statistical approximation.

@item
The number of times a procedure is called.
If a procedure is (directly) recursive, this column
will contain the number of calls from other procedures,
a plus sign, and then the number of recursive calls.
These numbers are exact, not approximate.

@item
The name of the procedure followed by its index number.
@end itemize

The predicate or function names are not just followed by their arity but
also by their mode in brackets.  A mode of zero corresponds to the first mode
declaration of that predicate in the source code.  For example,
@samp{list.delete/3(3)} corresponds to the @samp{(out, out, in)} mode
of @samp{list.delete/3}.

Now for the parent and child procedures the self and descendent time have
slightly different meanings.  For the parent procedures the self and descendent
time represent the proportion of the current procedure's self and descendent
time due to that parent.  These times are obtained using the assumption that
each call contributes equally to the total time of the current procedure.

@cindex Memory profiling
@cindex Allocation profiling
@cindex Profiling memory allocation

To create a profile of memory allocations, you can invoke @samp{mprof}
with the @samp{-m} (@samp{--profile memory-words}) option.
This will profile the amount of memory allocated, measured in units of words.
(A word is 4 bytes on a 32-bit architecture,
and 8 bytes on a 64-bit architecture.)

Alternatively, you can use @samp{mprof}'s @samp{-M}
(@samp{--profile memory-cells}) option.
This will profile memory in units of ``cells''.
A cell is a group of words allocated together in a single allocation,
to hold a single object.
Selecting this option this will therefore profile
the number of memory allocations,
while ignoring the size of each memory allocation.

With memory profiling, just as with time profiling,
you can use the @samp{-c} (@samp{--call-graph}) option to display
call graph profiles in addition to flat profiles.

When invoked with the @samp{-m} option, @samp{mprof} only reports
allocations, not deallocations (garbage collection).
It can tell you how much memory was allocated by each procedure,
but it won't tell you how long the memory was live for,
or how much of that memory was garbage-collected.
This is also true for @samp{mdprof}.

The memory retention profiling tool described in the next section can tell
you which memory cells remain on the heap.

@node Using mprof for profiling memory retention
@section Using mprof for profiling memory retention
@pindex mprof
@cindex Memory attribution
@cindex Memory retention
@cindex Heap profiling

When a program is built with memory profiling enabled and uses the Boehm
garbage collector, i.e. a grade with @samp{.memprof.gc} modifiers,
each memory cell is ``attributed'' with information about its origin
and type.  This information can be
collated to tell you what kinds of objects are being retained when
the program executes.

To do this, you must instrument the program by adding calls to
@code{benchmarking.report_memory_attribution/1} or
@code{benchmarking.report_memory_attribution/3}
at points of interest.
The first argument of the @code{report_memory_attribution} predicates is a
string that is used to label the memory retention data corresponding to that
call in the profiling output.
You may want to call them from within @samp{trace} goals:

@example
@group
trace [run_time(env("SNAPSHOTS")), io(!IO)] (
    benchmarking.report_memory_attribution("Phase 2", !IO)
)
@end group
@end example

If a program operates in distinct phases
you may want to add a call in between the phases.
The @samp{report_memory_attribution} predicates do nothing in other grades,
so are safe to leave in the program.

Next, build the program in a @samp{.memprof.gc} grade.
After the program has finished executing, it will generate a file
called @file{Prof.Snapshots} in the current directory.
Run @samp{mprof -s} to view the profile.
You will see the memory cells which were on the heap at each time
that @samp{report_memory_attribution} was called: the origin of the cells, and
their type constructors.

Passing the option @samp{-T} will group the profile first by
type constructors, then by procedure.  The @samp{-b} option produces a brief
profile by hiding the secondary level of information.
Memory cells allocated by the Mercury runtime system
itself are normally excluded from the profile; they can be viewed by passing
the @samp{-r} option.

Note that Mercury values which are dead may in fact be still reachable from the
various execution stacks. This is particularly noticeable on the high-level C
back-end, as the C compiler does not take conservative garbage collection into
account and Mercury values may linger on the C stack for longer than necessary.
The low-level C grades should suffer to a lesser extent.

The attribution requires an extra word of memory per cell, which
is then rounded up by the memory allocator.
This is accounted for in @samp{mprof} output, but the memory usage
of the program may be significantly higher than in non-memory profiling grades.

@node Using mdprof
@section Using mdprof
@pindex mdprof
@cindex Deep profiling

The user interface of the deep profiler is a browser.
To display the information contained in a deep profiling data file
(which will be called @file{Deep.data} unless you renamed it),
start up your browser and give it a URL of the form
@file{http://server.domain.name/cgi-bin/mdprof_cgi?/full/path/name/Deep.data}.
The @file{server.domain.name} part should be the name of a machine
with the following qualifications:
it should have a web server running on it,
and it should have the @samp{mdprof_cgi} program installed in
the web server's CGI program directory.
(On many Linux systems, this directory is @file{/usr/lib/cgi-bin}.)
The @file{/full/path/name/Deep.data} part
should be the full path name of the deep profiling data file
whose data you wish to explore.
The name of this file must not have percent signs in it,
and it must end in the suffix @file{.data}.

When you start up @samp{mdprof} using the command above,
you will see a list of the usual places
where you may want to start looking at the profile.
Each place is represented by a link.
Clicking on and following that link will give you a web page
that contains both the profile information you asked for
and other links,
some of which present the same information in a different form
and some of which lead to further information.
You explore the profile
by clicking on links and looking at the resulting pages.

The deep profiler can generate several kinds of pages.

@table @asis

@item The menu page
The menu page gives summary information about the profile,
and the usual starting points for exploration.

@item Clique pages
Clique pages are the most fundamental pages of the deep profiler.
Each clique page presents performance information about a clique,
which is either a single procedure or a group of mutually recursive procedures,
in a given ancestor context,
which in turn is a list of other cliques
starting with the caller of the entry point of the clique
and ending with the clique of the @samp{main} predicate.

Each clique page lists the closest ancestor cliques,
and then the procedures of the clique.
It gives the cost of each call site in each procedure,
as well as the cost of each procedure in total.
These costs will be just those incurred in the given ancestor context;
the costs incurred by these call sites
and procedures in other ancestor contexts
will be shown on other clique pages.

@item Procedure pages
Procedure pages give the total cost of a procedure and its call sites
in all ancestor contexts.

@item Module pages
Module pages give the total cost of all the procedures of a module.

@item Module getters and setters pages
These pages identifies the getter and setter procedures in a module.
Getters and setters are simply predicates and functions
that contain @samp{_get_} and @samp{_set_} respectively in their names;
they are usually used to access fields of data structures.

@item Program modules page
The program modules page gives the list of the program's modules.

@item Top procedure pages
Top procedure pages identify the procedures that are
most expensive as measured by various criteria.

@item Procedure caller pages
A procedure caller page lists the call sites, procedures, modules or cliques
that call the given procedure.

@end table

When exploring a procedure's callers,
you often want only the ancestors
that are at or above a certain level of abstraction.
Effectively you want to draw a line through the procedures of the program,
such that you are interested in the procedures on or above the line
but those below the line.
Since we want to exclude procedures below the line
from procedure caller pages,
we call this line an @emph{exclusion contour}.

You can tell the deep profiler where you want to draw this line
by giving it a @samp{exclusion contour file}.
The name of this file should be the same
as the name of the deep profiling data file,
but with the suffix @samp{.data} replaced with @samp{.contour}.
This file should consist of a sequence of lines,
and each line should contain two words.
The first word should be either @samp{all} or @samp{internal};
the second should the name of a module.
If the first word is @samp{all}, then
all procedures in the named module are below the exclusion contour;
if the first word is @samp{internal}, then
all internal (non-exported) procedures in the named module
are below the exclusion contour.
Here is an example of an exclusion contour file.

@example
all		bag
all		list
all		map
internal	set

@node Using threadscope

@cindex ThreadScope profiling
@cindex Parallel execution profiling

The ThreadScope tools are not distributed with Mercury.
For information about how to install them please see the
@file{README.ThreadScope} file included in the Mercury distribution.

ThreadScope provides two programs that can be used to view profiles in
@file{.eventlog} files.
The first, @samp{show-ghc-events}, lists the ThreadScope events sorted from the
earliest to the latest,
while the second, @samp{threadscope} provides a graphical display for browsing
the profile.

Both programs accept the name of a @file{.eventlog} file on the command
line.
The @samp{threadscope} program also provides a menu from which users can choose
a file to open.

@node Profiling and shared libraries
@section Profiling and shared libraries
@pindex mprof
@cindex Shared libraries and profiling
@cindex Profiling and shared libraries
@vindex LD_BIND_NOW

On some operating systems,
Mercury's profiling doesn't work properly with shared libraries.
The symptom is errors (@samp{map.lookup failed}) or warnings from @samp{mprof}.
On some systems, the problem occurs because the C implementation
fails to conform to the semantics specified by the ISO C standard
for programs that use shared libraries.
For other systems, we have not been able to analyze the cause of the failure
(but we suspect that the cause may be the same as on those systems
where we have been able to analyze it).

If you get errors or warnings from @samp{mprof},
and your program is dynamically linked,
try rebuilding your application statically linked,
e.g.@: by using @samp{MLFLAGS=--static} in your Mmakefile.
Another work-around that sometimes works is to set the environment variable
@env{LD_BIND_NOW} to a non-null value before running the program.

@node Invocation overview
@section Invocation overview

@code{mmc} is invoked as
@example
mmc [@var{options}] @var{arguments}
@end example

Arguments can be either module names or file names.
Arguments ending in @samp{.m} are assumed to be file names,
while other arguments are assumed to be module names, with
@samp{.} (rather than @samp{__}) as module qualifier.
If you specify a module name such as @samp{foo.bar.baz},
the compiler will look for the source in files @file{foo.bar.baz.m},
@file{bar.baz.m}, and @file{baz.m}, in that order.

Options are either short (single-letter) options preceded by a single @samp{-},
or long options preceded by @samp{--}.
Options are case-sensitive.
We call options that do not take arguments @dfn{flags}.
Single-letter flags may be grouped with a single @samp{-}, e.g.@: @samp{-vVc}.
Single-letter flags may be negated
by appending another trailing @samp{-}, e.g.@: @samp{-v-}.
Long flags may be negated by preceding them with @samp{no-},
e.g.@: @samp{--no-verbose}.

Do not disable optimizations that can distort deep profiles.

@item --no-delay-death
@findex --no-delay-death

@findex --enable-termination
Enable termination analysis.  Termination analysis analyses each mode of
each predicate to see whether it terminates.  The @samp{terminates},
@samp{does_not_terminate} and @samp{check_termination}
pragmas have no effect unless termination analysis is enabled.  When
using termination, @samp{--intermodule-optimization} should be enabled,
as it greatly improves the accuracy of the analysis.

@findex --check-term
@findex --check-termination
Enable termination analysis, and emit warnings for some predicates or
functions that cannot be proved to terminate.  In many cases in which the
compiler is unable to prove termination, the problem is either a lack of
information about the termination properties of other predicates, or the
fact that the program used language constructs (such as higher-order
calls) which cannot be analysed.  In these cases the compiler does
not emit a warning of non-termination, as it is likely to be spurious.

@subsection Grades and grade components
@cindex Grades and grade components

@table @asis
@item @code{-s @var{grade}}
@itemx @code{--grade @var{grade}}
@findex -s
@findex --grade
Select the compilation model.
The @var{grade} should be a @samp{.} separated list
in which the first element is a @samp{base grade},
and each following element (if any) is a @samp{grade modifier}.

@cindex csharp (compilation grade)
@cindex erlang (compilation grade)
@cindex java (compilation grade)

@cindex hlc (compilation grade)

@cindex asm_fast (compilation grade)
@cindex none (compilation grade)
@cindex reg (compilation grade)

The base grade specifies
what target language to compile the Mercury program to,
and if that the compiler can do this in several different ways,
selects one of those ways.
The available base grades are the following.

@c What target language to use (C, C#, Java or Erlang),
@c for C, whether to generate idiomatic C or assembly-like code,
@c and if the latter, what combination of GNU C extensions to use.
@c The options are 
@c which each specify the named language as the target,
@c and @samp{none}, @samp{reg}, and @samp{asm_fast},
@c which call for assembly-like C code,
@c with @samp{reg} and @samp{asm_fast} both calling for
@c the use of GNU C's extension for storing global variables in registers,
@c and @samp{asm_fast} calling for the use of two GNU C extensions
@c that together allow direct gotos to labels in other functions,
@c even in other modules.

@table @asis

@item @samp{hlc}
This base grade calls for generating idiomatic C,
which we call high level C.

@item @samp{none}, @samp{reg}, and @samp{asm_fast}
These base grades calls for generating assembly-like C code,
which we call low level C.
@samp{none} calls for generating standard C without using any GNU C extensions.
@samp{reg} and @samp{asm_fast} both call for
the use of GNU C's extension for storing global variables in registers,
while @samp{asm_fast} also calls for the use of two GNU C extensions
that together allow direct gotos to labels in other functions,
even in other modules.
In general, the more GNU C extensions are used,
the faster the programmer will be,
but some platforms, compilers or compiler versions
do not support specific extensions.

@item @samp{csharp}
This base grade calls for generating C#.

@item @samp{java}
This base grade calls for generating Java.

@item @samp{erlang}
This base grade calls for generating Erlang.
Note that support for generating Erlang is experimental.
@end table

The default base grade is system dependent,
but will be either @samp{hlc} or @samp{asm_fast},
as these are the two fastest.

@c @cindex hl (compilation grade)
@c @cindex asm_jump (compilation grade)
@c @cindex fast (compilation grade)
@c @cindex jump (compilation grade)

@c @cindex .agc (grade modifier)
@c @cindex .ssdebug (grade modifier)
@cindex .debug (grade modifier)
@cindex .decldebug (grade modifier)
@cindex .gc (grade modifier)
@cindex .memprof (grade modifier)
@cindex .mm (grade modifier)
@cindex .par (grade modifier)
@cindex .prof (grade modifier)
@cindex .profdeep (grade modifier)
@cindex .spf (grade modifier)
@cindex .stseg (grade modifier)
@cindex .threadscope (grade modifier)
@cindex .tr (grade modifier)
@cindex .trseg (grade modifier)

The grade modifiers may be given in any order.
Each grade modifier sets one or more compilation model options.
The available options each belong to a set of mutually exclusive alternatives
governing a single aspect of the compilation model.
The set of aspects and their alternatives are as follows.
Note that not all grade modifiers are applicable to all grades
(most apply only when targeting C),
and not all grade modifiers are compatible with each other.

@table @asis
@item garbage collection
The default is no garbage collection beyond what the target language provides.
C#, Java and Erlang have their own builtin garbage collectors, but C does not.
Since gc is essential for all programs
other than those with @emph{very} short runtimes,
base grades that target C
are usually followed by the @samp{.gc} grade modifier, which calls for
the use of the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative collector for C.
@c @samp{.agc}

@item profiling
The default is no profiling.
The grade modifier @samp{.prof} calls for gprof-style profiling;
the grade modifier @samp{.memprof} calls for profiling of memory usage;
while the grade modifier @samp{.profdeep} calls for deep profiling.
See @ref{Profiling} for an explanation
of the differences between these forms of profiling.

@item trailing
The default is no trailing.
Applications that need trailing should specify the grade modifier @samp{.tr}.
@samp{.trseg} is currently accepted as synonym for @samp{.tr}.

@item floating point precision
By default, the Mercury @samp{float} is implemented as
a double-precision floating point number,
which occupies 64 bits of space on virtually all platforms.
On platforms whose word size is 32 bits,
users whose programmers do not require double precision
may improve memory consumption and therefore speed by specifying
the grade modifier @samp{.spf} (short for single-precision float),
which calls for implementing all Mercury floats
as single-precision, 32 bit floating point numbers.
Note that on 64 bit platforms,
using single-precision floats
definitely will @emph{not} improve memory consumption,
and probably will not improve speed.
On the other hand, it may simplify the use of C APIs
that exclusively use single precision floats.

@item stack size
When generating assembly-like C code,
Mercury implements its own stacks (two of them).
The default is to make each stack a fixed size
(usually a relatively large size,
though the size of each stack can be controlled using runtime options).
We make the page(s) at the tops of the stacks inaccessible,
so that a stack overflow,
instead of accessing and overwriting memory effectively randomly,
causes the operating system to send a signal to the program.
If not caught and handled, this signal will abort the program,
minimizing the damage.

However, for programs for which this is not acceptable,
users can specify the @samp{.stseg} grade component.
This calls for each stack to be composed of
small memory segments chained together in a list.
When there is no room in the current segment for a new stack frame,
we simply allocate a new segment and add it to the list.
This approach has higher overhead,
since calls to and returns from procedures we must execute more code,
but it avoids imposing any limit on stack size
other than the size of available memory.

@item debugging
The default is to generate executables that do not support debugging.
However, when generating low level C code,
specifying one of the grade modifiers @samp{.debug} and @samp{.decldebug}
will cause the compiler to generate executables
that can be debugged using the Mercury debugger @samp{mdb}.
The difference between them is that
the declarative debugging aspects of @samp{mdb}
will work only with @samp{.decldebug}.
The price of this is that @samp{.decldebug} will result
in significantly larger executable files.
@c @samp{.ssdebug}

@item threads
The default is whatever thread support is given by the target language.
When targeting C,
thread support can be enabled by specifying the grade modifier @samp{.par}.
When targeting low level C,
this also enables the use of the parallel conjunction operator @samp{&}.
Since Mercury implements parallel conjunctions
only in low level C grades with the @samp{.par} grade modifier,
in every other situation, the compiler silently converts
every occurrence of @samp{&} to a comma,
the usual @emph{sequential} conjunctions operator.

@item thread profiling
In low level C grades with the grade modifier @samp{.par},
users can enable support for ThreadScope-style thread profiling
by also specifying the grade module @samp{.threadscope}.
The default is no support for profiling.
Note that support for this form of profiling is experimental.

@item minimal model tabling
The default is no support for minimal model evaluation.
When targeting low level C, users can specify the grade modifier @samp{.mm},
which enables support for minimal model tabled evaluation of procedures.

@end table

The default grade is system-dependent; it is chosen at installation time
by @samp{configure}, the auto-configuration script, but can be overridden
with the environment variable @env{MERCURY_DEFAULT_GRADE} if desired.
@vindex MERCURY_DEFAULT_GRADE
Depending on your particular installation, only a subset
of these possible grades will have been installed.
Attempting to use a grade which has not been installed
will result in an error at link time.
(The error message will typically be something like
@samp{ld: can't find library for -lmercury}.)

and grade modifier; they are followed by descriptions of those options.

@sp 1
@item @code{--profile-time} (grades: any grade containing @samp{.proftime})
@findex --profile-time
Similar to @samp{--profiling}, except that this option only gathers
timing information, not call counts.  For the results to be useful,
call counts for an identical run of your program need to be gathered
using @samp{--profiling} or @samp{--profile-calls}.
XXX this doesn't work, because the code addresses change.
The only advantage of using @samp{--profile-time} and @samp{--profile-calls}
to gather timing information and call counts in separate runs,
rather than just using @samp{--profiling} to gather them both at once,
is that the former method can give slightly more accurate timing results.
because with the latter method the code inserted to record call counts
has a small effect on the execution speed.

@findex --opt-level
@findex --optimization-level
@cindex Optimization levels
@cindex Compilation speed
@cindex Intermodule optimization
@cindex Cross-module optimization
Set optimization level to @var{n}.
Optimization levels range from -1 to 6.
Optimization level -1 disables all optimizations,
while optimization level 6 enables all optimizations
except for the cross-module optimizations listed below.
Some experimental optimizations (for example constraint
propagation) are not be enabled at any optimization level.

In general, there is a trade-off between compilation speed and the
speed of the generated code.  When developing, you should normally use
optimization level 0, which aims to minimize compilation time.  It
enables only those optimizations that in fact usually @emph{reduce}
compilation time.  The default optimization level is level 2, which
delivers reasonably good optimization in reasonable time.  Optimization
levels higher than that give better optimization, but take longer,
and are subject to the law of diminishing returns.  The difference in
the quality of the generated code between optimization level 5 and
optimization level 6 is very small, but using level 6 may increase
compilation time and memory requirements dramatically.

Note that if you want the compiler to perform cross-module
optimizations, then you must enable them separately;
the cross-module optimizations are not enabled by any @samp{-O}
level, because they affect the compilation process in ways
that require special treatment by @samp{mmake}.

The shell scripts in the Mercury compilation environment
will use the following environment variables if they are set.
There should be little need to use these, because the default
values will generally work fine.

@table @code
@item MERCURY_DEFAULT_GRADE
@vindex MERCURY_DEFAULT_GRADE
The default grade to use if no @samp{--grade} option is specified.

@sp 1
@item MERCURY_STDLIB_DIR
@vindex MERCURY_STDLIB_DIR
The directory containing the installed Mercury standard library.
@samp{--mercury-stdlib-dir} options passed to the @samp{mmc}, @samp{ml},
@samp{mgnuc} and @samp{c2init} scripts override the setting of
the @env{MERCURY_STDLIB_DIR} environment variable.

@sp 1
@item MERCURY_OPTIONS
@vindex MERCURY_OPTIONS
A list of options for the Mercury runtime system,
which gets linked into every Mercury program.
The options given in this environment variable apply to every program;
the options given in an environment variable
whose name is of the form @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS_@var{progname}}
apply only to programs named @var{progname}.
Options may also be set for a particular executable at compile time
by passing @samp{--runtime-flags} options
to the invocations of @samp{ml} and @samp{c2init} which create that executable.
These options are processed first,
followed by those in @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS},
with the options in @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS_@var{progname}} being processed last.

The Mercury runtime system accepts the following options.

@sp 1
@table @code

@c @item -a
@c If given force a redo when the entry point procedure succeeds;
@c this is useful for benchmarking when this procedure is model_non.

@c @item -c
@c Check how much of the space reserved for local variables
@c by mercury_engine.c was actually used.

@item -C @var{size}
@findex -C (runtime option)
Tells the runtime system to optimize the locations of the starts of the various
data areas for a primary data cache of @var{size} kilobytes.
The optimization consists of arranging the starts of the areas to differ as
much as possible modulo this size.

@c @item -d @var{debugflag}
@c @findex -d (runtime option)
@c Sets a low-level debugging flag.
@c These flags are consulted only if
@c the runtime was compiled with the appropriate definitions;
@c most of them depend on MR_LOWLEVEL_DEBUG.
@c For the meanings of the debugflag parameters,
@c see process_options() in mercury_wrapper.c
@c and do a grep for the corresponding variable.

@sp 1
@item -D @var{debugger}
@findex -D (runtime option)
Enables execution tracing of the program,
via the internal debugger if @var{debugger} is @samp{i}
and via the external debugger if @var{debugger} is @samp{e}.
(The mdb script works by including @samp{-Di} in MERCURY_OPTIONS.)
The external debugger is not yet available.

@sp 1
@item -p
@findex -p (runtime option)
Disables profiling.
This only has an effect if the executable was built in a profiling grade.

@sp 1
@item -P @var{num}
@findex -P (runtime option)
Tells the runtime system to create @var{num} threads for executing Mercury code
if the program was built in a parallel low-level C grade.
The Mercury runtime attempts to automatically determine this value if support
is available from the operating system.
If it cannot or support is unavailable it defaults to @samp{1}.

@sp 1
@item --max-engines @var{num}
@findex --max-engines (runtime option)
Tells the runtime system to allow a maximum of @var{num} POSIX threads, each
with its own Mercury engine.
This only affects programs in low-level C parallel grades.

@sp 1
@item --max-contexts-per-thread @var{num}
@findex --max-contexts-per-thread (runtime option)
Tells the runtime system to create at most @var{num} contexts per
POSIX thread for parallel execution.
Each context created requires a set of stacks, setting this value too high
can consume excess memory.
This only has an effect if the executable was built in a low-level C parallel
grade.

@c @sp 1
@c @item --num-contexts-per-lc-per-thread @var{num}
@c @findex --num-contexts-per-lc-per-thread (runtime option)
@c Tells the runtime system to use @var{num} contexts per POSIX thread to handle
@c each loop controlled loop.
@c This only has an effect if the executable was built in a low-level C parallel
@c grade.
@c
@c @sp 1
@c @item --runtime-granularity-wsdeque-length-factor @var{factor}
@c @findex --runtime-granularity-wsdeque-length-factor (runtime option)
@c Configures the runtime granularity control method not to create sparks if a
@c context's local spark wsdeque is longer than
@c @math{ @var{factor} * @var{num_engines}}.
@c @var{num_engines} is configured with the @samp{-P} runtime option.
@c
@c @sp 1
@c @item --profile-parallel-execution
@c @findex --profile-parallel-execution
@c Tells the runtime to collect and write out parallel execution profiling
@c information to a file named @file{parallel_execution_profile.txt}.
@c This only has an effect if the executable was built in a low level c,
@c parallel, threadscope grade.
@c
@c @sp 1
@c @item --threadscope-use-tsc
@c @findex --threadscope-use-tsc
@c Requests that the runtime's threadscope support use the CPU's time stamp
@c counter (TSC) to measure time rather than gettimeofday().  The TSC may
@c not always be available so the runtime may still use gettimeofday() even
@c with this option.

@sp 1
@item --thread-pinning
@findex --thread-pinning (runtime option)
Request that the runtime system attempts to pin Mercury engines (POSIX threads)
to CPU cores/hardware threads.
This only has an effect if the executable was built in a parallel low-level C
grade.
This is disabled by default but may be enabled by default in the future.
@c In case this is enabled by default the following comment is relevant.
@c This is disabled by default unless @samp{-P @var{num}} is not specified and the
@c runtime system is able to detect the number of processors enabled by the
@c operating system.

@c @item -r @var{num}
@c @findex -r (runtime option)
@c Repeats execution of the entry point procedure @var{num} times,
@c to enable accurate timing.

@c @item -t
@c @findex -t (runtime option)
@c Tells the runtime system to measure the time taken by
@c the (required number of repetitions of) the program,
@c and to print the result of this time measurement.

@sp 1
@item -T @var{time-method}
@findex -T (runtime option)
If the executable was compiled in a grade that includes time profiling,
this option specifies what time is counted in the profile.
@var{time-method} must have one of the following values:

@sp 1
@table @code
@item @samp{r}
Profile real (elapsed) time (using ITIMER_REAL).
@item @samp{p}
Profile user time plus system time (using ITIMER_PROF).
This is the default.
@item @samp{v}
Profile user time (using ITIMER_VIRTUAL).

@item --mem-usage-report @var{prefix}
@findex --mem-usage-report (runtime option)
Print a report about the memory usage of the program when the program
terminates.
The report is printed to a new file named @file{.mem_usage_report@var{N}}
for the lowest value of @var{N} (up to 99)
which doesn't overwrite an existing file.
Note that this capability is not supported on all operating systems.

@sp 1
@item --trace-count
@findex --trace-count (runtime option)
When the program terminates, generate a trace counts file listing all the
debugger events the program executed, if the program actually executed any
debugger events.
If @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS} includes the
@samp{--trace-count-output-file @var{filename}} option, then the trace counts
are put into the file @var{filename}.
If @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS} includes
the @samp{--trace-count-summary-file @var{basename}} option, then the trace
counts are put either in the file @var{basename} (if it does not exist), or in
@var{basename.N} for the lowest value of the integer @var{N} which doesn't
overwrite an existing file.
(There is a limit on the value of @var{N}; see the option
@samp{--trace-count-summary-max} below.)
If neither option is specified, then the output will be written to a file with
the prefix @samp{.mercury_trace_counts} and a unique suffix.
Specifying both options is an error.

@sp 1
@item --trace-count-summary-max @var{N}
@findex --trace-count-summary-max (runtime option)
If @env{MERCURY_OPTIONS} includes both
the @samp{--trace-count option} (or one of the other options that imply @samp{--trace-count})
and the @samp{--trace-count-summary-file @var{basename}} option,
then the generated program will put the generated trace counts
either in @var{basename} (if it does not exist),
or in @var{basename.N} for the lowest value of the integer @var{N}
which doesn't overwrite an existing file.
The @samp{--trace-count-summary-max} option specifies the maximum value of this
@var{N}.
When this maximum is reached,
the program will invoke the @samp{mtc_union} program
to summarize @var{basename}, @var{basename.1}, @dots{} @var{basename.N}
into a single file @var{basename}, and delete the rest.
By imposing a limit on the total number (and hence indirectly on the total
size) of these trace count files, this mechanism allows the gathering of trace
count information from a large number of program runs.
The default maximum value of @var{N} is 20.

@c @sp 1
@c @item --trace-count-summary-cmd=@var{cmd}
@c @findex --trace-count-summary-cmd=@var{cmd}
@c This option specifies the command to use instead of mtc_union

@c asks that Deep.data files (and Deep.procrep files) should be generated
@c only if by processes whose process id is evenly divisible by @var{N}.
@c This documentation is commented out because it is only for use by the

@c testing the code writing out deep profiling data).

@sp 1
@item --boehm-gc-free-space-divisor @var{N}
@findex --boehm-gc-free-space-divisor (runtime option)
This option sets the value of the free space divisor in the Boehm garbage
collector to @var{N}.
It is meaningful only when using the Boehm garbage collector.
The default value is 3. Increasing its value will reduce
heap space but increase collection time.
See the Boehm GC documentation for details.

@sp 1
@item --boehm-gc-calc-time
@findex --boehm-gc-calc-time (runtime option)
This option enables code in the Boehm garbage collector to calculate
the time spent doing garbage collection so far.
Its only effect is to enable the @samp{report_stats} predicate
in the @samp{benchmarking} module of the standard library
to report this information.

@sp 1

@chapter Using a different C compiler
@cindex C compilers
@cindex Using a different C compiler
@cindex GNU C
@findex --cc

The Mercury compiler takes special advantage of certain extensions
provided by GNU C to generate much more efficient code.  We therefore
recommend that you use GNU C for compiling Mercury programs.
However, if for some reason you wish to use another compiler,
it is possible to do so.  Here's what you need to do.

@itemize @bullet
@item Create a new configuration for the Mercury system using the
@samp{mercury_config} script, specifying the different C compiler, e.g.@:
@samp{mercury_config --output-prefix=/usr/local/mercury-cc --with-cc=cc}.

@item Add the @samp{bin} directory of the new configuration to the beginning
of your PATH.

@item
You must use a grade beginning with @samp{none}, @samp{hlc} or @samp{hl}
(e.g.@: @samp{hlc.gc}).
You can specify the grade in one of three ways: by setting the
@env{MERCURY_DEFAULT_GRADE} environment variable, by adding a line
@vindex MERCURY_DEFAULT_GRADE
@samp{GRADE=@dots{}} to your @samp{Mmake} file, or by using the
@samp{--grade} option to @samp{mmc}.  (You will also need to install
those grades of the Mercury library, if you have not already done so.)

@item
If your compiler is particularly strict in
enforcing ANSI compliance, you may also need to compile the Mercury
code with @samp{--no-static-ground-terms}.

@end itemize

@node Foreign language interface
@chapter Foreign language interface

The Mercury foreign language interfaces allows @samp{pragma foreign_proc} to
specify multiple implementations (in different foreign programming
languages) for a procedure.

If the compiler generates code for a procedure using a back-end for which
there are multiple applicable foreign languages, it will choose the
foreign language to use for each procedure according to a builtin ordering.

If the language specified in a @samp{foreign_proc} is not available for a
particular back-end, it will be ignored.

If there are no suitable @samp{foreign_proc} clauses for a particular
procedure but there are Mercury clauses, they will be used instead.

@table @asis

@item @samp{C}
This is the default foreign language on all back-ends which compile to C.
Only available on back-ends that compile to C.

@item @samp{C#}
This is the only foreign language for back-ends which compile to C#.

@item @samp{Erlang}
This is the only foreign language for back-ends which compile to Erlang.

@item @samp{Java}
This is the only foreign language for back-ends which compile to Java.

@end table

@node Stand-alone interfaces
@chapter Stand-alone interfaces

Programs written in a language other than Mercury
should not make calls to foreign exported Mercury procedures
unless the Mercury runtime has been initialised.
(In the case where the Mercury runtime has not been initialised,
the behaviour of these calls is undefined.)
Such programs must also ensure that
any module specific initialisation is performed
before calling foreign exported procedures in Mercury modules.
Likewise, module specific finalisation may need to be performed
after all calls to Mercury procedures have been made.

A stand-alone interface provides a mechanism by which
non-Mercury programs may initialise (and shut down)
the Mercury runtime plus a specified set of Mercury libraries.

A stand-alone interface is created by invoking the compiler
with the @samp{--generate-standalone-interface} option.
The set of Mercury libraries to be included in the stand-alone interface
is given via one of the usual mechanisms
for specifying what libraries to link against,
e.g. the @samp{--ml} and @samp{--mld} options. (@pxref{Libraries}).
The Mercury standard library is always included in this set.

In C grades,
the @samp{--generate-standalone-interface} option
causes the compiler to generate
an object file that should be linked into the executable.
This object file contains two functions:
@code{mercury_init()} and @code{mercury_terminate()}.
The compiler also generates a C header file
that contains the prototypes of these functions.
(This header file may be included in C++ programs.)
The roles of the two functions are described below.

@table @b
@item @bullet{} @code{mercury_init()}
Prototype:
@example
void mercury_init(int @var{argc}, char **@var{argv}, void *@var{stackbottom});
@end example

Initialise the Mercury runtime, standard library and any other Mercury
libraries that were specified when the stand-alone interface was generated.
@var{argc} and @var{argv} are the argument count and argument vector,
as would be passed to the function @code{main()} in a C program.
@var{stackbottom} is the address of the base of the stack.
In grades that use conservative garbage collection this is used to
tell the collector where to begin tracing.
This function must be called before any Mercury procedures
and must only be called once.
It is recommended that the value of @var{stackbottom} be set by passing
the address of a local variable in the @code{main()} function of a program,
for example:
@example
    int main(int argc, char **argv) @{
        void *dummy;
        mercury_init(argc, argv, &dummy);
        @dots{}
    @}
@end example
Note that the address of the stack base should be word aligned as
some garbage collectors rely upon this.
(This is why the type of the dummy variable in the above example is
@code{void *}.)
If the value of @var{stackbottom} is @code{NULL} then the collector will attempt
to determine the address of the base of the stack itself.
Note that modifying the argument vector, @var{argv}, after the Mercury runtime
has been initialised will result in undefined behaviour since the runtime
maintains a reference into @var{argv}.

@sp 1
@item @bullet{} @code{mercury_terminate()}
Prototype:
@example
int mercury_terminate(void);
@end example

Shut down the Mercury runtime.
The value returned by this function is Mercury's exit status
(as set by the predicate @samp{io.set_exit_status/3}).
This function will also invoke any finalisers contained in the set
of libraries for which the stand-alone interface was generated.
@end table

The basename of the object and header file are provided as
the argument of @samp{--generate-standalone-interface} option.

@c XXX Mention that stand-alone interfaces work with debugging or
@c (deep) profiling?

Stand-alone interfaces are not required if the target language is Java
or C#.
For those target languages the Mercury runtime will be automatically
initialised when the classes or library assemblies containing code generated
by the Mercury compiler are loaded.

Stand-alone interfaces are not currently supported when the target language is
Erlang.

For an example of using a stand-alone interface see the
@samp{samples/c_interface/standalone_c} directory in the Mercury distribution.

% The following is a list of the functions and predicates that are
% present in list.m but not in one_or_more.m, together with the reasons
% for their absences.
%
% - pred is_empty/1
% - pred is_not_empty/1
%
%   When applied to known-to-be-nonempty lists, the outcomes of these tests
%   are known statically.
%
% - func det_head/1
% - func det_tail/1
%
%   For nonempty lists, the simple head and tail functions are already
%   deterministic.
%
% - func append/2
%
%   You can append two one_or_mores using the ++ function, and the compiler
%   already gets confused by whether references to append with an arity
%   less than three is a reference to the function or to the predicate version.
%
% - pred remove_suffix/3
%
%   When the suffix is removed, there may be no element left.
%
% - pred reverse_prepend/3
%
%   In list.m, it is part of the implementation of reverse, but one_or_more.m
%   implements reverse by calling list.reverse.
%   XXX We could implement reverse_prepend nevertheless.
%
% - pred insert/3
%
%   In the reverse modes, where the caller is deleting an element,
%   there may be no element left.
%
% - func ../2
%
%   Depending on the values of the lower and upper bounds, the resulting list
%   may be empty.
%
% - func det_last/1
% - pred det_last/2
% - pred det_split_last/3
%
%   For nonempty lists, the simple last function and predicate,
%   and the split_last predicate, are already deterministic.
%
% - pred take/3
% - pred det_take/3
% - func take_upto/2
% - pred take_upto/3
% - pred drop/3
% - pred det_drop/3
%
%   Depending on the value of the count parameter, the resulting list
%   may contain no elements.
%
% - pred take_while/4
% - func take_while/2
% - pred take_while/3
% - func drop_while/2
% - pred drop_while/3
%
%   Depending on the value of the count parameter, the resulting list
%   may contain no elements.
%
% - func duplicate/1
% - pred duplicate/2
%
%   Depending on the value of the count parameter, the resulting list
%   may contain no elements.

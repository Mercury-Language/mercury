    % chunk_foldl(ChunkSize, Pred, List, !Acc):
    %
    % Does the same job as foldl(Pred, List, !Acc), but using
    % two nested loops, not one.
    %
    % In most grades, the implementation of foldl can handle lists
    % of arbitrary length, the reason being that tail recursion optimization
    % allows it to do its work using only one stack frame. However, in some
    % grades (including debugging and some profiling grades) tail recursion
    % optimization is not available, which means that foldl will need
    % a separate stack frame for processing each element. With long lists,
    % this can exhaust the stack.
    %
    % chunk_foldl addresses this issue by replacing foldl's single loop
    % with an outer and an inner loop. Each invocation of the inner loop
    % processes one chunk of the list (whose length is given by ChunkSize),
    % and when it is done with that chunk, the inner loop returns, which
    % means that it frees up all the stack frames that it used. The outer loop
    % then continues to invoke the inner loop until all elements of List
    % have been processed.
    %
    % With this arrangement, the maximum number of stack frames needed
    % to process a list of length N is N/ChunkSize + ChunkSize, the former
    % being the number of frames used by the outer loop, and the latter

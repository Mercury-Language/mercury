% If we're doing heap reclamation on failure, then in order to implement any
% sort of code that requires terms to survive backtracking, we need to
% (deeply) copy them out of the heap and into some other area before
% backtracking. The obvious thing to do then is just call the generator
% predicate, let it run to completion, and copy its result into another memory
% area (call it the solutions heap) before forcing backtracking. When we get
% the next solution, we do the same, this time passing the previous collection
% (which is still on the solutions heap) to the collector predicate. If the
% result of this operation contains the old collection as a part, then the
% deep copy operation is smart enough not to copy again. So this could be
% pretty efficient.
%
% But what if the collector predicate does something that copies the previous
% collection?  Then on each solution, we'll copy the previous collection to
% the heap, and then deep copy it back to the solution heap. This means
% copying solutions order N**2 times, where N is the number of solutions.
% So this isn't as efficient as we hoped.
%
% So we use a slightly different approach. When we find a solution, we deep
% copy it to the solution heap. Then, before calling the collector code, we
% sneakily swap the runtime system's notion of which is the heap and which is
% the solutions heap. This ensures that any terms are constructed on the
% solutions heap. When this is complete, we swap them back, and force the
% engine to backtrack to get the next solution. And so on. After we've
% gotten the last solution, we do another deep copy to move the solution back
% to the 'real' heap, and reset the solutions heap pointer (which of course
% reclaims all the garbage of the collection process).
%
% Note that this will work with recursive calls to builtin_aggregate as
% well. If the recursive invocation occurs in the generator pred, there can
% be no problem because by the time the generator succeeds, the inner
% do_ call will have completed, copied its result from the solutions heap,
% and reset the solutions heap pointer. If the recursive invocation happens
% in the collector pred, then it will happen when the heap and solutions heap
% are 'swapped.'  This will work out fine, because the real heap isn't needed
% while the collector pred is executing, and by the time the nested do_ is
% completed, the 'real' heap pointer will have been reset.
%
% If the collector predicate throws an exception while they are swapped,
% then the code for builtin_throw/1 will unswap the heaps.
% So we don't need to create our own exception handlers to here to
% cover that case.
%
% If we're not doing heap reclamation on failure (as is currently the
% case when using conservative GC), then all of the heap-swapping
% and copying operations are no-ops, so we get a "zero-copy" solution.

% Note that the code for builtin_aggregate is very similar to the code
% for do_while (below).

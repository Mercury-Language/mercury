%
% This module provides a barrier implementation.
%
% A barrier is a position in a program that any thread (of N threads)
% must be suspended at until all the other threads (of N) reach the same
% position.
%
% Barriers are represented by calls to barrier/3 (defined below). Different
% code locations can belong to the same conceptual barrier using values of
% type barrier. The same code location can also be used by multiple
% barriers by supplying different values.

    % wait(Barrier, !IO)
    %
    % Indicate that the current thread has reached the barrier. Throws a
    % software_error/1 exception if this barrier has been used by more than
    % N threads.

    % release_barrier(Barrier, !IO)
    %
    % Release all the threads waiting at the barrier regardless of whether
    % or not N threads have arrived at the barrier. This can be called by
    % any thread, it does not have to be a thread that would normally call
    % wait/3.

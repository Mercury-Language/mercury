%
% A bit buffer provides an interface between bit-oriented output requests
% and byte-array-oriented streams, storing bits until there are enough bytes
% to make calling the `put' method on the stream worthwhile.
%
% CAVEAT: the user is referred to the documentation in the header
% of array.m regarding programming with unique objects (the compiler
% does not currently recognise them, hence we are forced to use
% non-unique modes until the situation is rectified; this places
% a small burden on the programmer to ensure the correctness of his
% code that would otherwise be assured by the compiler.)

    % For a write_buffer, a bit_buffer is allocated that is bits_per_int
    % larger than the size requested. This allows a full word to be
    % written at any time. After each write, the position is checked.
    % If the position is greater than the requested size, a chunk of the
    % requested size is written to the stream. The unwritten bits are
    % then copied to the start of the buffer.
    %
    % We always use a buffer size that is at least the size of a word
    % so that writing a word to the buffer will require at most a single
    % call to `put'. Allowing smaller sizes complicates the code
    % for a case that shouldn't occur in practice.

    % than writing them to an output stream.
